[switch clicks]

00:50.840 --> 00:53.107
[Ed] It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

00:53.109 --> 00:53.875
And through that,

00:53.877 --> 00:55.509
the inhuman spirit
tricked you.

00:55.511 --> 00:58.246
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

00:58.248 --> 01:00.548
[nurse 1]
What's an inhuman spirit?

01:00.550 --> 01:01.616
[Ed] It's something
that's never

01:01.618 --> 01:04.418
walked the earth
in human form.

01:04.420 --> 01:05.920
It's something demonic.

01:05.922 --> 01:09.323
[nurse 2] So,
the doll was never possessed?

01:09.325 --> 01:12.227
[Lorraine] No,
it was used as a conduit.

01:12.229 --> 01:15.096
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

01:15.098 --> 01:17.899
Demonic spirits
don't possess things.

01:17.901 --> 01:19.968
They possess people.

01:19.970 --> 01:22.370
It wanted to
get inside of you.

01:22.372 --> 01:25.473
And given
this unusual feature,

01:25.475 --> 01:28.075
the doll will need to be
properly cared for.

01:28.077 --> 01:29.477
- Cared for?
- [Ed] Mmm-hmm.

01:29.479 --> 01:31.148
It should be destroyed.

01:33.550 --> 01:36.551
That would
only make things worse.

01:36.553 --> 01:38.989
We think it best
the doll come with us.

01:40.422 --> 01:42.623
We'll keep it somewhere safe.

01:42.625 --> 01:45.126
That sounds like
a great idea.

01:45.128 --> 01:46.462
She's all yours.

Eh, about an hour.

02:13.222 --> 02:15.123
Why don't you put your
head back? Get some rest.

02:15.125 --> 02:18.292
No, you get lost coming home
from the supermarket.

02:18.294 --> 02:21.995
[chuckling] If I do that,
we might end up in California.

02:21.997 --> 02:24.197
Well, so you wake up
to the sound of the Pacific.

02:24.199 --> 02:26.267
- Nothing wrong with that.
- [both chuckle]

02:26.269 --> 02:28.069
I'll pick up Judy
on the way.

02:28.071 --> 02:30.537
Ah, that actually sounds
so nice, Ed.

02:30.539 --> 02:32.175
We should plan on it.

03:01.370 --> 03:02.636
Yeah.

03:02.638 --> 03:04.440
We got it covered. Thanks.

03:10.380 --> 03:11.382
Nice doll.

03:12.148 --> 03:13.383
That's what you think.

03:15.718 --> 03:18.553
All right, you're gonna head
three miles back to the last exit.

03:18.555 --> 03:21.755
You'll hop on 26,
that'll loop you around.

Bridgewater from?

Well, you know what?
I think we missed our turn.

and find out.

Surely,
He scorneth the scorners,

10:23.646 --> 10:27.881
but He giveth grace
unto the lowly.

10:27.883 --> 10:31.117

the glory,

for a living?

Shouldn't you be
in math class?

Mary Ellen!

16:39.120 --> 16:41.121
I babysat the Smiths
for over two years

16:41.123 --> 16:42.322
and never told you
what they did.

16:42.324 --> 16:43.891
Oh, what do they do?

16:43.893 --> 16:45.291
They're podiatrists.

16:45.293 --> 16:46.959
- So not the same.
- [chuckles]

16:46.961 --> 16:48.962
Well, obviously,
I'm coming over later.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.429
We do have
that social studies project

16:50.431 --> 16:52.098
- that we need to work on.
- Uh...

16:52.100 --> 16:53.534
We don't have any project.

16:53.536 --> 16:54.970
Okay, but how would
they know?

16:55.370 --> 16:56.870
She's psychic.

16:56.872 --> 16:59.006
Then, they're heroes.

16:59.008 --> 17:00.573
I think
they're concerned parents

17:00.575 --> 17:02.074
who wouldn't want
negative influences

17:02.076 --> 17:03.209
around their child.

inside the house?

17:10.519 --> 17:12.985
Is it all creepy music
and cobwebs?

17:12.987 --> 17:14.555
No. No, it's boring suburbia.

17:14.557 --> 17:16.226
The inside
of your locker is scarier.

17:18.961 --> 17:22.396
Wait. Whose party,
and why wasn't I invited?

17:22.398 --> 17:23.563
Judy's birthday is coming up,

17:23.565 --> 17:25.432
so we're gonna
celebrate early.

17:25.434 --> 17:28.301
You really are the best
babysitter, you know that?

17:28.303 --> 17:30.404
Compliments will
get you nowhere.

17:30.406 --> 17:31.571
What about threats?

- [Bob] See you soon.

17:38.246 --> 17:39.378
You wouldn't.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.981
You know what they call him,
right?

18:03.872 --> 18:06.039
- I think so.
- Oh, cool.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.273
You live near the Warrens,
don't you, Bob?

18:07.275 --> 18:08.309
[Bob] Uh...

18:08.311 --> 18:11.377
Yeah, Mary Ellen's babysitting
for them tonight.

18:11.379 --> 18:13.914
Yeah. Yeah, I live
right across the street.

18:13.916 --> 18:16.250
Do you ever see
anything scary over there?

18:16.252 --> 18:18.085
Like a ghost, maybe?

18:18.087 --> 18:19.319
Bob...

18:19.321 --> 18:20.354
Mrs. Faley went ahead

18:20.356 --> 18:22.889
and dropped a can
of tomato sauce in aisle five,

18:22.891 --> 18:26.026
and it looks like a crime
scene, so get the mop.

18:26.028 --> 18:27.293
Ladies. Did you find
everything okay?

18:27.295 --> 18:28.328
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yes, sir.

18:28.330 --> 18:30.430
Bob here is not giving you
any trouble, is he?

18:30.432 --> 18:31.397
- [chuckles] No.
- No.

18:31.399 --> 18:32.665
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks, Dad.
- All right.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.467
I'll do it right after.

18:34.469 --> 18:35.871
So, what'd you see?

18:36.972 --> 18:39.039
At the Warrens'?

18:39.041 --> 18:40.607
- Uh, nothing. Nothing.

Oh.

18:45.246 --> 18:47.347
But you knew
what the Warrens did?

18:47.349 --> 18:49.950
There were rumors,
I guess, but...

18:49.952 --> 18:51.550
Rumors. Interesting.

18:51.552 --> 18:54.421
Did you know there's a rumor
going around about you, Bob?

18:54.423 --> 18:56.690
Wait, really?
[stammers] What is it about?

18:56.692 --> 18:58.258
Uh, it's about a girl
who has a...

18:58.260 --> 19:00.196
[whispers] Fine. You can come.
Stop.

19:01.996 --> 19:03.996
- [Bob] Oh. Sorry.
- [Mary Ellen] Sorry.

19:03.998 --> 19:06.265
- That's totally my fault.
- It's okay.

19:06.267 --> 19:08.402
- [cash register dings]
- Um... So, what...

19:08.404 --> 19:09.636
Bye, Bob. Thanks.

19:09.638 --> 19:10.639
Bye.

19:12.407 --> 19:14.543
Uh, she forgot her eggs, so...

19:15.276 --> 19:16.643
Here.

19:16.645 --> 19:18.147
She likes you.

Don't touch her.

19:37.265 --> 19:38.632
You'll get obsessed.

19:38.634 --> 19:40.567
- It's "possessed."
- That's what I said.

19:40.569 --> 19:43.036
Anyways, if you know so much,

19:43.038 --> 19:43.904
why don't you tell us

19:43.906 --> 19:45.575
if you can catch cooties
from a ghost?

19:46.207 --> 19:47.441
You can't.

19:47.443 --> 19:49.142
Well, then how'd you get 'em?

19:49.144 --> 19:50.676
- [all laugh]
- [Mary Ellen] Anthony Rios!

19:50.678 --> 19:52.314
Don't make me

19:53.148 --> 19:54.213
Please don't.

Come on.

19:59.154 --> 20:01.324
I'm sorry I can't come
to your birthday party, Judy.

20:03.024 --> 20:04.558
You can't either?

20:04.560 --> 20:06.225
My parents said
I'm not really prepared

20:06.227 --> 20:07.496
to process death yet.

20:09.497 --> 20:11.197
It's a birthday party.

20:11.199 --> 20:12.234
I'm sorry.

20:25.214 --> 20:27.414
[Mary Ellen] Hey, how long
has that been happening?

20:27.416 --> 20:29.519
Since everyone heard about
the article this week.

20:30.651 --> 20:32.085
Please don't tell my parents.

20:32.087 --> 20:34.687
I won't.
I won't as long as you do.

20:34.689 --> 20:36.690
- I don't want them to worry.
- They're parents.

20:36.692 --> 20:37.758
They're worried
about everything

20:37.760 --> 20:39.262
whether they need to be
or not.

20:46.167 --> 20:47.033
Are you sure the bullying is

20:47.035 --> 20:48.667
the only thing
that's bothering you?

20:48.669 --> 20:50.169
That isn't bothering me.

20:50.171 --> 20:51.473
You know what I mean.

20:57.245 --> 20:59.648
And remember our deal.
No secrets.

21:00.349 --> 21:02.049
[Judy] I know.

21:02.051 --> 21:03.252
I don't have any.

21:04.753 --> 21:06.422
What did you get
at the store?

21:07.156 --> 21:08.521
A surprise.

21:08.523 --> 21:11.424
- You said no secrets.
- A surprise isn't a secret.

21:11.426 --> 21:14.597

- It's a surprise. [chuckles]

22:11.119 --> 22:13.552
It tells you if you're in
the presence of any spirits.

22:13.554 --> 22:15.355
- So, it is one.
- [Judy] No.

22:15.357 --> 22:17.757
It's just a bell.

So, Judy.

Don't your parents, like, keep
any creepy stuff around?

22:36.278 --> 22:37.644
[Judy] No.

22:37.646 --> 22:40.082
They keep it all locked away
in a room.

22:42.583 --> 22:44.550
Well, can we at least
go in and look?

22:44.552 --> 22:45.687
[Mary Ellen] No!

22:47.321 --> 22:49.625
It's not really good
for anyone to go in there.

22:52.461 --> 22:53.830

They're my old ones.

into the afterlife
and stuff...

Judy...

42:45.618 --> 42:47.953
Ghosts used to be people.

42:47.955 --> 42:50.592
And not every person
you meet is bad...

42:52.092 --> 42:55.429
so maybe not all ghosts
are bad, either.

- What?

It's this case the Warrens
investigated about this girl

43:11.946 --> 43:14.012
who was terrorized by
something called the Ferryman.

43:14.014 --> 43:15.848

[Daniela] It was a case
the Warrens investigated

43:47.581 --> 43:49.818
about a hellhound that
possessed a man in England.

43:51.451 --> 43:53.120
He terrorized the shit
out of this town.

over their eyes?

44:06.132 --> 44:07.134

44:08.868 --> 44:10.201
[Daniela] Oh, I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

44:10.203 --> 44:12.570
They used to put them
over the eyes of the dead

44:12.572 --> 44:13.639
to pay the Ferryman,
so he could

44:13.641 --> 44:15.574
take their souls
to the underworld.

44:15.576 --> 44:16.942
It was his toll.

44:16.944 --> 44:19.011
Okay, we should go.

44:19.013 --> 44:21.712
It's okay. I sometimes
like to snoop, too.

44:21.714 --> 44:24.148
[Daniela] Do you know
what this does, Judy?

44:24.150 --> 44:26.453
I think it's called
a Mourner's Bracelet.

44:28.822 --> 44:31.926
It helps you contact
your lost loved ones.

44:40.467 --> 44:42.166
- What's that?
- Um...

44:42.168 --> 44:44.806
It's a case my parents
investigated recently.

44:45.672 --> 44:47.105
The wedding dress.

44:47.107 --> 44:48.710
It haunts people.

44:49.777 --> 44:52.580
And it makes them violent.

44:54.214 --> 44:55.746
Where is the dress now?

44:55.748 --> 44:57.051
Down the hall
in the artifact room.

45:00.554 --> 45:03.191
I mean, that's where
all this stuff is.

45:03.790 --> 45:04.724
Right, Judy?

45:04.726 --> 45:06.961
- That's what you said earlier.
- Oh, um...

45:07.228 --> 45:08.559
Yeah.

45:08.561 --> 45:10.795
My dad says
that everything in there

45:10.797 --> 45:14.199
is either haunted, cursed,

45:14.201 --> 45:17.636
or used in some
ritualistic practice.

45:17.638 --> 45:19.070
What about the doll
that's in there?

45:19.072 --> 45:20.505
Because I read this interview
with your dad...

45:20.507 --> 45:21.509
No.

45:23.877 --> 45:25.513
Don't talk about her.

45:28.715 --> 45:29.717
Why not?

45:33.953 --> 45:36.156
She's in a case for a reason.

45:37.558 --> 45:39.224
Okay, we should go.

45:39.226 --> 45:40.291

I don't remember that one.

46:15.261 --> 46:16.530

46:17.063 --> 46:18.933
Let's find out.

46:25.772 --> 46:27.940
Okay. Okay,
so you draw a card

46:27.942 --> 46:29.241
and whatever picture
it has on it

46:29.243 --> 46:30.576
is the object you try to find

46:30.578 --> 46:32.244
by feeling around
inside the box.

46:32.246 --> 46:34.179
If the object you pull out
matches the picture,

46:34.181 --> 46:35.183
then you get a point.

46:38.085 --> 46:39.585

A doll?

01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:08.527

Wait, wait, Judy, don't.

01:35:53.236 --> 01:35:55.637
And as for young Anthony,

01:35:55.639 --> 01:35:57.609
he better hope I don't
run into him anytime soon.

01:35:57.909 --> 01:35:59.675
Ed.

01:35:59.677 --> 01:36:00.846
[doorbell ringing]

01:36:12.822 --> 01:36:13.924
Happy birthday, Judy.

01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:16.127
[Judy] Thank you.

01:36:16.826 --> 01:36:17.862
Happy birthday.

01:36:21.132 --> 01:36:24.602
I, uh, had a little talk
with my brother.

01:36:24.901 --> 01:36:26.268
Thanks.

01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:28.037
Come in.

01:36:28.039 --> 01:36:30.542
[Mary Ellen] Is it okay
if my boyfriend joins?

01:36:31.275 --> 01:36:32.210
Sure.

01:36:34.078 --> 01:36:35.043
Um...

01:36:35.045 --> 01:36:37.781
- Hi, uh, thanks for having us.
- [Ed] Hey.

01:36:38.648 --> 01:36:39.982
Bob's-Got-Balls.

01:36:39.984 --> 01:36:41.649
No kidding.

01:36:41.651 --> 01:36:43.786
- [girl] Hi, Judy!
- Happy birthday, Judy!

01:36:43.788 --> 01:36:45.354
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

01:36:45.356 --> 01:36:48.090
- Hello, Judy, happy birthday.
- [Ed] Hey, guys, welcome.

01:36:48.092 --> 01:36:49.891
- Keep comin'.
- [both chuckle]

01:36:49.893 --> 01:36:51.359
[Anthony]
Happy birthday, Judy.

01:36:51.361 --> 01:36:52.897
- Anthony?
- [Anthony] I'm really sorry.

01:36:53.763 --> 01:36:55.734
Am I still invited?

01:36:57.234 --> 01:36:58.270
Sure.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:05.142
[Lorraine] Daniela?

01:37:06.177 --> 01:37:07.976
I have something for you.

01:37:07.978 --> 01:37:09.179
[Daniela] For me?

01:37:11.882 --> 01:37:12.918
[sighs]

01:37:20.991 --> 01:37:22.992
You found out the hard way

01:37:22.994 --> 01:37:26.394
that there is a lot of evil
in this room.

01:37:26.396 --> 01:37:28.799
But you know
what I actually like about it?

01:37:31.067 --> 01:37:33.838
All the evil in here...

01:37:35.106 --> 01:37:38.643
reminds me of all the good
that's out there.

01:37:54.691 --> 01:37:56.293
[Lorraine whispers]
Darling Daniela.

01:38:01.731 --> 01:38:03.399
Did Judy tell you that?

01:38:03.401 --> 01:38:05.704
No. Your dad did.

01:38:10.307 --> 01:38:13.678
He also tells me
that he misses you.

01:38:15.945 --> 01:38:19.081
And to stop being
so hard on yourself,

01:38:19.083 --> 01:38:21.315
'cause it was
not your fault.

01:38:21.317 --> 01:38:22.820
[sobbing]

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:25.089
[sniffles]

01:38:31.361 --> 01:38:33.030
Thank you.

01:38:34.898 --> 01:38:36.364
Um... [sniffles]

01:38:36.366 --> 01:38:37.433
I'm sorry.

01:38:37.435 --> 01:38:38.801
Oh.

01:38:38.803 --> 01:38:40.101
It's okay.

01:38:40.103 --> 01:38:41.373
You're young.

01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:48.277
You know,
when I was about your age,

01:38:48.279 --> 01:38:51.447
I once ran off with
a boyfriend for three days

01:38:51.449 --> 01:38:53.284
without telling my parents.

01:38:54.285 --> 01:38:55.654
[chuckles]

01:38:56.152 --> 01:38:58.153
I unleashed a demon.

01:38:58.155 --> 01:38:59.758
So not the same thing.

01:39:00.725 --> 01:39:02.727
Well, okay. True.

01:39:03.494 --> 01:39:05.362
[both chuckle]

01:39:08.932 --> 01:39:11.201
Does Mr. Warren know
about this boyfriend?

01:39:12.136 --> 01:39:13.772
He was the boyfriend.

01:39:18.275 --> 01:39:20.141
[Ed] Anybody wanna
hear a song? Whoa!

01:39:20.143 --> 01:39:22.146
- [boy] Yeah!
- [all cheering]

01:39:24.048 --> 01:39:25.950
[Ed] All right, okay.

01:39:59.441 --> 01:40:04.441

02:23.661 --> 02:25.746
Will!

02:26.706 --> 02:29.541
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

02:31.461 --> 02:33.003
You look beautiful.

02:34.964 --> 02:38.508
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

02:38.551 --> 02:41.886
- Make way! Let me through!
- How dare you!

02:41.928 --> 02:45.348
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

02:46.433 --> 02:49.185
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

02:49.227 --> 02:53.397
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

02:55.233 --> 03:00.363
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

03:00.405 --> 03:03.406
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

03:05.785 --> 03:09.412
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

03:14.418 --> 03:19.047
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- ls it? That's annoying. My mistake.

03:19.090 --> 03:21.549
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?

03:21.592 --> 03:25.260
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

03:25.345 --> 03:29.473
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.767
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?

03:31.810 --> 03:35.437
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.065
That wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.

03:38.108 --> 03:41.777
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

03:41.903 --> 03:45.321
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

03:45.406 --> 03:47.782
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

03:48.158 --> 03:51.577
The charge is "conspiring to set free"

03:51.620 --> 03:55.331
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

03:55.416 --> 03:59.252
"and condemned to death,
for which the..."

03:59.294 --> 04:02.964
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

04:05.426 --> 04:08.635
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

04:08.678 --> 04:10.679
Captain.

04:11.973 --> 04:17.519
Captain Jack Sparrow.

04:17.603 --> 04:19.813
Yes, I thought you might.

04:21.524 --> 04:26.778
♪ Fifteen men
on a dead man's chest

04:26.821 --> 04:31.699
♪ Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

04:31.783 --> 04:37.121
♪ Drink and the devil
had done for the rest

04:37.164 --> 04:41.876
♪ Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

05:04.482 --> 05:06.608
Prisoners, come on!

05:16.117 --> 05:17.367
Aaah!

06:44.743 --> 06:46.744
Sorry, mate.

06:48.873 --> 06:52.041
Mind if we make a little side trip?

06:52.918 --> 06:55.253
I didn't think so.

07:01.385 --> 07:05.304
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,

07:05.388 --> 07:07.472
were overcome.

07:08.850 --> 07:12.311
- You got what you went in for, then?
- Mm-hmm.

07:14.731 --> 07:17.816
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

07:17.859 --> 07:21.320
were expecting something
a bit more... shiny,

07:21.362 --> 07:25.573
the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

07:25.657 --> 07:28.284
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.

07:28.327 --> 07:30.995
- And the hurricane.
- Aye.

07:31.079 --> 07:35.499
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

07:38.045 --> 07:41.005
- Shiny.
- Aye, shiny.

07:42.090 --> 07:44.133
Is that how you're all feeling?

07:44.176 --> 07:49.554
That perhaps dear old Jack is not
serving your best interests as captain?

07:49.722 --> 07:51.932
Walk the plank.

07:52.016 --> 07:55.018
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.

07:55.102 --> 07:58.480
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

08:06.614 --> 08:10.199
- You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.496
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.

08:16.665 --> 08:19.500
It is a drawing of a key.

08:25.882 --> 08:27.800
Gentlemen,

08:27.884 --> 08:29.802
what do keys do?

08:30.804 --> 08:32.679
Keys...

08:32.763 --> 08:35.139
...unlock things?

08:35.224 --> 08:39.060
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

08:39.144 --> 08:42.397
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.065
No.

08:44.149 --> 08:48.569
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

08:48.654 --> 08:52.532
So, what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

08:52.574 --> 08:57.077
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

08:57.161 --> 08:59.496
So we're going after this key.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.916
You're not making any sense at all.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.377
Any more questions?

09:05.461 --> 09:08.046
So... do we have a heading?

09:08.089 --> 09:10.257
Ah! A heading.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.803
Set sail in a... uh...

09:15.721 --> 09:17.722
...general...

09:22.436 --> 09:24.311
That-way direction.

09:24.396 --> 09:25.563
Captain?

09:25.605 --> 09:28.941
Come on, snap to and make sail.
You know how this works. Go on.

09:33.947 --> 09:36.240
Have you noticed lately

09:36.283 --> 09:40.952
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

09:41.037 --> 09:43.830
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

09:43.914 --> 09:46.958
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

09:47.001 --> 09:50.837
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

10:04.684 --> 10:07.644
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

10:07.729 --> 10:10.064
Those won't be necessary.

10:13.818 --> 10:18.655
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

10:22.659 --> 10:24.660
We wish for you to act as our agent

10:24.745 --> 10:28.873
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

10:28.957 --> 10:31.334
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?

10:31.460 --> 10:34.378
We've had dealings in the past.

10:35.297 --> 10:39.008
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

10:39.051 --> 10:41.427
What mark did he leave on you?

10:44.013 --> 10:47.891
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

10:47.975 --> 10:50.018
I would like you to go to him

10:50.103 --> 10:54.648
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

10:54.690 --> 10:57.442
Recover. At the point of a sword?

10:58.027 --> 11:00.070
Bargain.

11:06.326 --> 11:08.494
Letters of marque.

11:09.746 --> 11:12.331
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.

11:12.374 --> 11:16.627
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

11:17.379 --> 11:22.216
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

11:22.259 --> 11:24.385
Freedom.

11:25.303 --> 11:28.680
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.640
The world is shrinking,

11:30.724 --> 11:34.144
the blank edges of the map filled in.

11:34.228 --> 11:38.106
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

11:38.190 --> 11:40.942
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

11:41.026 --> 11:43.903
You and your fiancée
face the hangman's noose.

11:44.613 --> 11:49.409
- So you get Jack and the Black Pearl.
- The Black Pearl?

11:49.451 --> 11:53.203
- The property you want he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.

11:53.246 --> 11:57.833
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

11:57.917 --> 12:01.503
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.214
A compass?

12:04.257 --> 12:06.425
Ah, you know it.

12:07.802 --> 12:12.138
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

12:37.580 --> 12:39.956
Why is the rum always gone?

12:45.922 --> 12:47.255
Oh.

12:48.466 --> 12:51.009
That's why.

12:56.973 --> 12:59.016
As you were, gents.

13:30.214 --> 13:32.215
Ah.

13:34.176 --> 13:36.135
Time's run out, Jack.

13:54.654 --> 13:57.239
Bootstrap.

13:57.323 --> 13:59.533
Bill Turner.

14:04.246 --> 14:06.622
You look good, Jack.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.589
Is this a dream?

14:15.674 --> 14:17.091
No.

14:17.175 --> 14:20.761
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

14:28.644 --> 14:31.146
You got the Pearl back, I see.

14:31.856 --> 14:35.692
I had some help retrieving
the Pearl, by the way.

14:36.819 --> 14:39.321
Your son.

14:39.405 --> 14:41.865
William?

14:42.616 --> 14:45.035
He ended up a pirate after all.

14:45.870 --> 14:49.830
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

14:49.914 --> 14:52.082
He sent me.

14:53.418 --> 14:56.086
Davy Jones.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.756
Oh.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.841
So it's you, then.

15:02.427 --> 15:05.763
He shanghaied you into service, eh?

15:05.805 --> 15:07.848
I chose it.

15:07.932 --> 15:12.935
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

15:13.729 --> 15:16.272
I stood up for you.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.775
Everything went wrong after that.

15:20.944 --> 15:25.782
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

15:25.824 --> 15:28.785
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

15:28.869 --> 15:30.452
Unable to move.

15:32.372 --> 15:34.748
Unable to die, Jack.

15:34.791 --> 15:40.420
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

15:41.005 --> 15:43.298
I would trade anything for it.

15:45.176 --> 15:48.637
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

15:48.679 --> 15:51.390
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

15:51.474 --> 15:53.933
He raised the Pearl
from the depths for you.

15:53.975 --> 15:56.268
Thirteen years,
you've been her captain.

15:56.353 --> 15:58.187
- Technically...
- Jack.

15:58.271 --> 16:00.689
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

16:00.774 --> 16:03.526
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

16:03.610 --> 16:07.947
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

16:07.989 --> 16:10.449
The Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...

16:10.492 --> 16:12.868
Then it's the locker for you!

16:12.953 --> 16:16.162
Jones's terrible leviathan
will find you

16:16.247 --> 16:20.625
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.

16:21.502 --> 16:25.171
Any idea when Jones
might release said terrible beastie?

16:27.049 --> 16:29.008
I already told you, Jack.

16:30.970 --> 16:33.263
Your time is up.

16:34.181 --> 16:36.181
It comes now,

16:36.266 --> 16:41.645
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

16:50.738 --> 16:54.032
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

16:54.075 --> 16:56.368
On deck! Scurry!

16:56.453 --> 17:01.038
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

17:01.123 --> 17:04.917
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

17:05.002 --> 17:09.380
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

17:09.465 --> 17:12.884
- Do we have a heading?
- Aah! Ooh. Run! Land.

17:18.015 --> 17:21.725
- Which port?
- Didn't say. I said "land." Any land.

17:28.065 --> 17:31.276
- Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- No, no!

17:31.360 --> 17:33.653
Leave it!

17:34.280 --> 17:36.740
Run.

17:37.617 --> 17:40.744
Back to your stations, the lot of you!

17:49.252 --> 17:50.920
- Jack?
- Shh.

17:50.962 --> 17:56.467
For the love of mother and child,
Jack, what's coming after us?

17:56.551 --> 17:58.260
Nothing.

19:11.664 --> 19:15.917
- Here, now, you can't be here.
- I think you'll find he can.

19:16.002 --> 19:17.502
Mr. Swann!

19:17.545 --> 19:19.671
Governor Swann, still.

19:19.714 --> 19:23.008
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

19:23.050 --> 19:26.261
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

19:26.345 --> 19:30.807
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and
convince him to return to Port Royal.

19:30.850 --> 19:33.559
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

19:33.643 --> 19:37.354
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

19:37.439 --> 19:39.982
Is that a lack of faith
in Jack or in me?

19:40.025 --> 19:42.443
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow's

19:42.527 --> 19:46.363
does not mean he would do
the same for anyone else.

19:46.406 --> 19:50.701
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

19:51.369 --> 19:53.871
I have faith in you.

19:53.955 --> 19:55.580
Both of you.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.835
Where will you find him?

20:00.878 --> 20:05.590
Tortuga. I'll start there and I
won't stop searching till I find him.

20:05.674 --> 20:09.552
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

20:09.595 --> 20:12.930
- Properly?
- Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

20:14.016 --> 20:16.808
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

20:24.525 --> 20:29.071
- I'll wait for you.
- Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

20:38.497 --> 20:40.665
Captain Jack Sparrow?

20:41.708 --> 20:46.087
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

20:46.171 --> 20:50.091
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

20:50.133 --> 20:54.470
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.597
Jack Sparrow?

20:56.640 --> 20:58.724
I haven't seen him in a month.

20:58.767 --> 21:02.602
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

21:03.646 --> 21:06.231
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

21:06.273 --> 21:08.942
but there's an island
just south of the straits

21:09.026 --> 21:11.403
where I trade spice for...

21:11.445 --> 21:14.114
...mmm, delicious long pork.

21:15.700 --> 21:19.786
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.

21:19.870 --> 21:22.205
A ship with black sails.

21:29.713 --> 21:31.630
My brother will take you ashore.

21:42.434 --> 21:45.393
What's wrong? The beach is there.

21:45.477 --> 21:47.145
What?

21:49.940 --> 21:51.399
Bon voyage, monsieur.

22:17.383 --> 22:19.926
Jack!

22:20.011 --> 22:22.012
Jack Sparrow!

22:27.894 --> 22:29.935
Marty!

22:30.771 --> 22:32.521
Cotton!

22:33.482 --> 22:35.483
Anybody?

22:40.781 --> 22:42.865
Ah. A familiar face.

22:42.908 --> 22:45.284
Don't eat me.

22:45.368 --> 22:48.370
- I'm not going to eat you.
- Don't eat me.

22:48.455 --> 22:51.039
No. Don't eat me.

23:01.967 --> 23:03.968
Gibbs.

23:34.207 --> 23:36.249
Come on! Let's go!

23:39.336 --> 23:41.212
Come on! Who wants it?

23:44.007 --> 23:46.342
I can do this all day!

24:50.738 --> 24:52.280
Jack?

24:52.323 --> 24:54.699
Jack Sparrow!

24:54.783 --> 24:57.452
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.

25:06.210 --> 25:08.170
Jack, it's me.

25:08.212 --> 25:09.546
Will Turner.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.387
Tell them to let me down!

25:20.642 --> 25:22.643
...Eensy-weensy.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.524
...Eunuchy. Snip, snip.

25:32.694 --> 25:34.862
Eunuchy.

25:37.699 --> 25:40.201
- Jack, the compass.
- That's all I need.

25:40.243 --> 25:43.329
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for helping you.

25:43.372 --> 25:45.748
She faces the gallows!

25:53.381 --> 25:55.173
Savvy?

26:01.472 --> 26:02.722
Save me.

26:02.765 --> 26:06.059
Jack, what did you tell them?

26:06.143 --> 26:08.186
No!

26:08.604 --> 26:10.896
What about Elizabeth?

26:10.981 --> 26:12.564
Jack!

26:14.943 --> 26:17.653
That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.

26:17.737 --> 26:22.074
- We don't bite.
- Go on. We won't bite you.

26:24.661 --> 26:27.246
Come quickly.

26:27.288 --> 26:30.582
- Tell me what's happening.
- Our name still has some standing.

26:30.625 --> 26:34.210
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.

26:34.253 --> 26:36.254
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

26:36.338 --> 26:38.423
We cannot count on William Turner.

26:38.465 --> 26:41.551
- Come!
- He's better than you give him credit.

26:41.593 --> 26:45.179
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only,

26:45.264 --> 26:47.598
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

26:47.641 --> 26:49.392
Even if Will succeeds,

26:49.435 --> 26:51.978
do not ask me to endure
the sight of my daughter

26:52.062 --> 26:54.563
walking to the gallows. Do not.

26:55.606 --> 27:00.027
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

27:00.111 --> 27:02.404
A fair trial for Will
ends in a hanging.

27:02.447 --> 27:05.157
Then there is nothing left
for you here.

27:09.287 --> 27:11.288
Whoa!

27:12.373 --> 27:14.499
Wait inside.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.626
Captain?

27:20.130 --> 27:22.131
Captain.

27:27.929 --> 27:30.264
Evening, governor.

27:30.307 --> 27:32.308
Shame, that.

27:32.392 --> 27:34.560
He was carrying this.

27:34.644 --> 27:37.353
It's a letter to the king.

27:37.438 --> 27:39.814
- It's from you.
- No...

27:43.152 --> 27:45.320
Elizabeth.

27:46.072 --> 27:48.448
What are you doing?

27:51.160 --> 27:53.661
- Where is she?
- Who?

28:11.387 --> 28:15.641
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

28:15.683 --> 28:18.018
as your father believes.

28:18.812 --> 28:21.354
Then what is?

28:21.438 --> 28:24.690
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

28:24.775 --> 28:30.071
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.

28:30.155 --> 28:33.366
- I'm here to negotiate.
- I'm listening.

28:35.911 --> 28:38.204
I'm listening intently.

28:39.915 --> 28:42.542
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.

28:42.584 --> 28:47.379
Yes, and they're not valid until they
bear my signature and my seal.

28:47.421 --> 28:50.132
Or else I would not still be here.

28:50.216 --> 28:54.261
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

28:54.345 --> 28:58.098
- It will do you no good.
- Do explain.

28:58.182 --> 29:02.894
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

29:02.979 --> 29:05.104
There is something
you need to know.

29:05.188 --> 29:07.273
Ah, I see.

29:07.357 --> 29:10.484
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

29:10.569 --> 29:13.737
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

29:14.447 --> 29:16.907
But you mustn't worry.

29:17.450 --> 29:20.828
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

29:20.912 --> 29:23.414
My desires are not so provincial.

29:24.082 --> 29:28.418
There's more than one chest
of value in these waters.

29:29.670 --> 29:33.715
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

29:36.177 --> 29:41.055
Consider into your calculations that
you robbed me of my wedding night.

29:41.098 --> 29:43.308
So I did.

29:45.269 --> 29:47.562
A marriage interrupted...

29:49.856 --> 29:52.608
...or fate intervenes?

29:53.109 --> 29:56.612
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

29:56.696 --> 29:59.239
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Oh, really?

29:59.282 --> 30:02.034
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then,

30:02.911 --> 30:05.662
I'll still want that compass.

30:05.747 --> 30:09.374
Consider that in your calculations.

30:28.977 --> 30:32.104
I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.

30:32.147 --> 30:34.814
And I say it was me being clever.

30:34.899 --> 30:38.735
Ain't that right, poochie?

30:38.819 --> 30:41.154
How'd you know it weren't
Divine Providence

30:41.239 --> 30:42.989
what inspired you to be clever?

30:43.074 --> 30:45.200
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

30:45.284 --> 30:50.622
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?

30:50.665 --> 30:55.334
Since we're not immortal no more. We
gotta take care of our immortal souls.

30:55.377 --> 30:56.669
You know you can't read.

30:56.711 --> 30:59.171
It's the Bible.
You get credit for trying.

30:59.256 --> 31:04.760
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...

31:06.638 --> 31:07.763
Look.

31:08.390 --> 31:10.516
There it is.

31:15.146 --> 31:17.188
What's got into him?

31:17.273 --> 31:19.440
Must have seen a catfish.

31:26.615 --> 31:28.741
Stupid mongrel!

31:44.632 --> 31:47.301
Come on!

31:53.725 --> 31:57.978
- It's ours for the taking.
- Tide's coming in. That should help.

31:58.062 --> 32:00.856
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

32:00.898 --> 32:02.815
There's the truth of it!

32:10.324 --> 32:13.284
Suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,

32:13.368 --> 32:16.620
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

32:16.705 --> 32:19.373
Amen to that.

32:35.556 --> 32:37.599
Thank you.

32:54.449 --> 32:57.743
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

32:57.786 --> 33:00.287
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

33:00.330 --> 33:03.957
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.169
So he had no choice. He's a captive
as much as the rest of us.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.087
Worse, as it turns out.

33:09.129 --> 33:13.966
See, the Pelegostos believe
that Jack is a god in human form,

33:14.009 --> 33:15.927
and they intend to do him the honor

33:15.969 --> 33:18.638
of releasing him
from his fleshy prison.

33:23.644 --> 33:26.145
They'll roast him and eat him.

33:27.189 --> 33:28.981
Where's the rest of the crew?

33:29.066 --> 33:33.652
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

33:35.988 --> 33:38.156
The feast is about to begin.

33:38.741 --> 33:40.992
Jack's life will end

33:41.035 --> 33:43.370
when the drums stop.

33:44.956 --> 33:47.666
Well, we can't just sit here
and wait, then, can we?

33:50.128 --> 33:52.795
No, no. Oi! No, no.

33:52.838 --> 33:56.006
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

33:56.091 --> 33:58.217
I am chief. Want big fire.

33:58.301 --> 34:00.511
Come on.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.973
...Tout suite.

34:04.015 --> 34:06.350
Come on. More wood.

34:33.294 --> 34:35.336
Whoa!

35:14.833 --> 35:16.834
Oh, bugger.

35:26.511 --> 35:28.678
A little seasoning, eh?

35:42.484 --> 35:44.068
Well done.

36:23.399 --> 36:26.817
Put your legs through. Start to climb!

36:27.860 --> 36:32.030
Come on, men! It'll take all of us
to crew the Black Pearl!

36:32.115 --> 36:34.866
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

36:34.951 --> 36:37.286
About six would do.

36:40.873 --> 36:42.666
Oh, dear.

36:46.129 --> 36:48.838
- Hurry!
- Come on!

36:50.882 --> 36:54.969
Come on! ls that all you got?

37:02.644 --> 37:05.187
- Wait. Stop.
- Eh?

37:05.647 --> 37:07.940
- Stop.
- Shh, shh.

37:15.072 --> 37:16.406
Shh.

37:20.036 --> 37:22.454
- What are they doing?
- Stop.

37:28.336 --> 37:30.545
Snake! Aaah!

37:48.396 --> 37:50.147
Move!

38:16.422 --> 38:18.590
Well, go on, go get them.

38:24.138 --> 38:26.431
No, no. Oi! No, no!

38:28.768 --> 38:30.435
Not good.

38:46.702 --> 38:48.953
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

39:07.930 --> 39:09.723
Roll the cage!

39:09.807 --> 39:12.142
Come on!

39:36.708 --> 39:38.208
Lift the cage! Hurry!

39:38.293 --> 39:41.587
Come on, lads.
Lift it like a lady's skirt.

40:37.766 --> 40:39.099
Run!

40:52.947 --> 40:54.280
This way, lads!

41:18.263 --> 41:19.638
Take cover!

41:20.974 --> 41:22.432
Stop it!

42:17.612 --> 42:18.986
Bugger.

42:46.513 --> 42:49.223
Haul loose the mooring line!

42:49.308 --> 42:51.559
The mooring line!

42:51.644 --> 42:55.313
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

42:55.356 --> 42:58.650
- Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!

42:58.692 --> 43:01.361
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

43:01.403 --> 43:04.863
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

43:04.948 --> 43:07.491
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

43:07.533 --> 43:10.494
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?

43:10.536 --> 43:13.872
- I won't leave without him.
- Oi!

43:22.048 --> 43:24.966
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!

43:33.809 --> 43:36.852
- Make ready to cast off!
- Oi!

43:40.357 --> 43:41.691
Good doggy.

43:58.124 --> 44:01.584
Alas, my children, this is the day
you shall always remember

44:01.669 --> 44:03.670
as the day that you almost...

44:07.550 --> 44:09.758
...Captain Jack Sparrow.

44:35.075 --> 44:38.786
Let's put some distance between us and
this island and head out to open sea.

44:38.871 --> 44:43.249
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

44:43.292 --> 44:45.460
That seems a bit contradictory, captain.

44:45.502 --> 44:48.671
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.

44:48.756 --> 44:51.841
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

44:57.513 --> 44:59.931
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

44:59.974 --> 45:02.809
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?

45:02.852 --> 45:05.437
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.

45:05.480 --> 45:10.400
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

45:11.694 --> 45:14.195
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

45:14.279 --> 45:16.822
I must trade it for her freedom.

45:19.159 --> 45:21.827
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain.

45:21.870 --> 45:24.955
We have a need to travel upriver.

45:24.998 --> 45:28.501
By need,
do you mean a trifling need?

45:28.585 --> 45:32.379
Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?

45:32.464 --> 45:36.299
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

45:36.342 --> 45:40.178
What we need to do is make sail
for Port Royal with all haste.

45:40.221 --> 45:42.180
William,

45:42.223 --> 45:44.307
I shall trade you the compass

45:44.350 --> 45:46.184
if you will help me

45:46.268 --> 45:48.478
to find this.

45:52.149 --> 45:54.651
- You want me to find this?
- No.

45:55.778 --> 45:58.195
You want you to find this...

45:58.279 --> 46:02.366
...because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

46:02.492 --> 46:04.576
and/or locating in your discovering

46:04.661 --> 46:08.288
a way to save your dolly belle,
ol' what's-her-face.

46:09.290 --> 46:10.624
Savvy?

46:13.670 --> 46:16.088
This is going to save Elizabeth?

46:18.508 --> 46:21.467
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

46:23.804 --> 46:25.388
Not much.

46:25.472 --> 46:28.474
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

46:54.792 --> 46:57.335
What's all this?

46:58.004 --> 47:00.839
If you both fancy the dress,
you'll just have to share

47:00.923 --> 47:02.966
and wear it one after the other.

47:03.050 --> 47:06.343
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

47:07.012 --> 47:09.263
Is it, now? And you?

47:09.306 --> 47:13.517
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

47:13.602 --> 47:16.103
All the men, they can feel it.

47:16.188 --> 47:19.940
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

47:20.025 --> 47:22.318
searching for her husband, lost at sea.

47:22.402 --> 47:24.987
A virgin too, likely as not.

47:25.071 --> 47:27.322
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

47:27.406 --> 47:31.951
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

47:31.994 --> 47:34.704
No! That will just
anger the spirit, sir.

47:34.788 --> 47:37.457
What we need to do is find out
what the spirit needs,

47:37.541 --> 47:39.000
and then get it back to her.

47:39.084 --> 47:41.252
Enough! Enough!

47:41.295 --> 47:45.506
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

47:45.591 --> 47:48.926
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

47:48.968 --> 47:51.261
A young woman, by the look of it.

47:51.304 --> 47:53.972
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

47:54.015 --> 47:56.642
Oh, and, uh, she's probably naked.

48:26.672 --> 48:29.173
Why is Jack afraid
of the open ocean?

48:29.216 --> 48:31.634
Well,
if you believe such things,

48:31.677 --> 48:35.095
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones.

48:35.179 --> 48:39.766
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

48:39.850 --> 48:43.353
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

48:44.689 --> 48:46.022
The kraken.

48:49.527 --> 48:53.405
They say the stench of its breath
is like...

48:53.489 --> 48:57.032
imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

48:57.117 --> 48:58.701
is the roar of the kraken

48:58.785 --> 49:02.913
and the reeking odor
of a thousand rotting corpses.

49:04.958 --> 49:07.251
If you believe such things.

49:07.335 --> 49:09.753
And the key will spare him that?

49:10.505 --> 49:13.966
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

49:14.050 --> 49:16.551
Bad enough even to go visit...

49:17.469 --> 49:19.637
...her.

49:19.722 --> 49:21.597
Her?

49:21.682 --> 49:23.725
Aye.

49:58.676 --> 50:02.428
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

50:02.471 --> 50:06.432
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

50:06.516 --> 50:08.893
Were. Have been.

50:09.853 --> 50:10.936
Before.

50:10.979 --> 50:14.023
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

50:14.107 --> 50:19.987
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

50:20.072 --> 50:21.280
Mind the boat.

50:21.323 --> 50:23.740
Mind the boat.

50:36.253 --> 50:39.506
Jack Sparrow.

50:39.590 --> 50:41.758
Tia Dalma.

50:42.551 --> 50:47.012
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

50:51.810 --> 50:53.644
You...

50:56.147 --> 50:58.774
You have a touch of...

50:58.817 --> 51:02.277
...destiny about you,

51:02.320 --> 51:04.154
William Turner.

51:05.949 --> 51:08.116
You know me?

51:08.158 --> 51:10.827
You want to know me.

51:10.869 --> 51:12.495
There'll be no knowing here.

51:12.538 --> 51:15.540
We've come for help
and we're not leaving without it.

51:15.624 --> 51:19.293
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

51:19.336 --> 51:21.504
- Come.
- Come.

51:25.175 --> 51:29.678
What service may I do you?

51:30.388 --> 51:34.349
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment.

51:37.979 --> 51:39.980
Look.

51:40.022 --> 51:43.525
An undead monkey.

51:43.609 --> 51:45.819
Top that.

51:49.740 --> 51:53.659
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

51:54.077 --> 51:56.662
The payment is fair.

51:56.705 --> 51:58.706
We're looking for this.

52:01.251 --> 52:04.086
And what it goes to.

52:05.547 --> 52:10.217
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

52:10.260 --> 52:13.720
Maybe. Why?

52:13.762 --> 52:16.097
I hear you.

52:16.182 --> 52:20.643
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

52:21.312 --> 52:23.605
Or do you know,

52:23.689 --> 52:27.567
but are loath to claim it as your own?

52:29.320 --> 52:31.362
Your key go to a chest.

52:31.947 --> 52:36.450
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

52:36.534 --> 52:39.495
- What is inside?
- Gold?

52:39.579 --> 52:43.624
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

52:43.708 --> 52:46.919
Nothing bad, I hope?

52:47.629 --> 52:50.547
You know of Davy Jones,

52:50.590 --> 52:52.174
yes?

52:52.258 --> 52:55.052
A man of the sea.

52:55.094 --> 52:57.428
A great sailor,

52:57.471 --> 53:02.475
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

53:02.559 --> 53:05.603
What vexes all men?

53:07.105 --> 53:09.607
What indeed?

53:10.192 --> 53:12.235
- The sea.
- Sums.

53:12.277 --> 53:14.111
The dichotomy of good and evil.

53:15.906 --> 53:19.491
A woman.

53:19.575 --> 53:21.701
He fell in love.

53:21.786 --> 53:24.788
No, no, no, no. I heard
it was the sea he fell in love with.

53:24.830 --> 53:28.792
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

53:28.876 --> 53:31.253
See, it was a woman

53:31.295 --> 53:34.089
as changing and harsh

53:34.131 --> 53:37.551
and untamable as the sea.

53:37.635 --> 53:40.053
Him never stopped loving her.

53:40.137 --> 53:44.974
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

53:45.016 --> 53:47.726
but not enough to cause him to die.

53:49.479 --> 53:53.983
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

53:54.025 --> 53:55.985
Him heart.

53:56.069 --> 53:58.195
Literally or figuratively?

53:58.280 --> 54:02.824
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

54:02.866 --> 54:04.909
Could he?

54:04.994 --> 54:10.248
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

54:11.125 --> 54:12.834
And so...

54:12.876 --> 54:15.587
...him carve out him heart,

54:16.213 --> 54:20.883
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.845
The key,

54:23.929 --> 54:28.515
he keep with him at all times.

54:29.142 --> 54:31.018
- You knew this.
- I did not.

54:31.060 --> 54:33.687
I didn't know where the key was.
But now we do.

54:33.730 --> 54:37.232
All that's left is climb aboard
the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,

54:37.317 --> 54:40.027
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass.

54:40.069 --> 54:41.903
Let me see your hand.

54:56.501 --> 54:59.003
The black spot!

55:00.005 --> 55:03.549
- The black spot!
- Black spot!

55:03.967 --> 55:07.053
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

55:07.137 --> 55:10.597
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

55:14.060 --> 55:17.562
My little beauty,
where are you?

55:17.647 --> 55:21.191
Such a long time in such a mess.

55:23.235 --> 55:26.154
Davy Jones cannot make port.

55:26.238 --> 55:29.574
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

55:30.076 --> 55:33.327
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

55:33.411 --> 55:35.954
and so you will carry land with you.

55:45.256 --> 55:47.257
Dirt.

55:48.385 --> 55:51.970
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

55:54.390 --> 55:57.266
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

55:57.309 --> 56:00.269
If you don't want it, give it back.

56:00.771 --> 56:03.940
- No.
- Then it helps.

56:06.151 --> 56:11.197
It seems we have a need
to find the Flying Dutchman.

56:14.326 --> 56:18.120
A touch of destiny.

56:33.553 --> 56:35.137
That's the Flying Dutchman?

56:38.098 --> 56:40.850
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

56:40.934 --> 56:43.310
Do not underestimate her.

56:44.771 --> 56:49.150
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

56:49.234 --> 56:52.737
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

56:52.821 --> 56:55.156
And if there are crewmen?

56:55.240 --> 56:57.533
I cut down anyone in my path.

56:58.326 --> 57:01.286
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

57:01.328 --> 57:04.330
Your chariot awaits you, sire.

57:07.585 --> 57:08.752
Oi!

57:08.836 --> 57:10.837
If you do happen to get captured,

57:10.880 --> 57:14.632
just say Jack Sparrow
sent you to settle his debt.

57:14.675 --> 57:19.095
- It might save your life.
- Bon voyage!

57:22.557 --> 57:25.184
Douse the lamps.

58:06.849 --> 58:07.891
Sailor.

58:07.975 --> 58:10.560
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!

58:10.645 --> 58:13.063
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

58:13.105 --> 58:15.857
There's no use. You've run aground.

58:15.900 --> 58:17.317
No.

58:17.401 --> 58:19.569
Beneath us.

58:20.404 --> 58:22.781
Foul breath.

58:35.377 --> 58:37.920
Hey! Hey!

59:15.331 --> 59:18.166
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

59:33.140 --> 59:37.018
Get back! Get back!

01:00:08.633 --> 01:00:12.302
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

01:00:29.444 --> 01:00:32.613
Do you fear death?

01:00:34.032 --> 01:00:38.869
Do you fear that dark abyss?

01:00:40.746 --> 01:00:43.539
All your deeds laid bare.

01:00:44.416 --> 01:00:47.794
All your sins punished.

01:00:49.254 --> 01:00:51.756
I can offer you

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.300
an escape.

01:00:54.385 --> 01:00:56.052
Don't listen to him!

01:01:06.145 --> 01:01:09.106
Do you not fear death?

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:14.194
I'll take my chances, sir.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:16.697
To the depths.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.203
Cruel blackguard!

01:01:24.246 --> 01:01:26.455
Life is cruel.

01:01:27.374 --> 01:01:30.126
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

01:01:30.669 --> 01:01:33.838
I offer you a choice.

01:01:33.922 --> 01:01:36.590
Join my crew

01:01:36.675 --> 01:01:39.051
and postpone the judgment.

01:01:40.429 --> 01:01:43.931
One hundred years before the mast.

01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:48.184
Will ye serve?

01:01:50.021 --> 01:01:52.022
I will serve.

01:01:52.106 --> 01:01:54.524
There.

01:02:01.407 --> 01:02:04.951
You are neither dead nor dying.

01:02:04.994 --> 01:02:06.619
What is your purpose here?

01:02:10.415 --> 01:02:13.584
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

01:02:14.753 --> 01:02:17.963
What is your purpose here?

01:02:18.048 --> 01:02:21.300
Jack Sparrow...
sent me to settle his debt.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:26.805
Did he, now?

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:30.349
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

01:02:45.824 --> 01:02:46.824
Oh.

01:02:47.284 --> 01:02:50.078
You have a debt to pay.

01:02:50.162 --> 01:02:53.580
You've been captain
of the Black Pearl for 13 years.

01:02:53.664 --> 01:02:55.749
That was our agreement.

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:59.669
Technically, I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

01:02:59.754 --> 01:03:03.548
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

01:03:03.633 --> 01:03:06.968
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

01:03:07.011 --> 01:03:09.554
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:03:12.517 --> 01:03:15.476
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.

01:03:15.519 --> 01:03:18.687
- One soul is not equal to another.
- Aha!

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:21.607
We've established my proposal
is sound in principle.

01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:23.609
Now we're haggling over price.

01:03:25.529 --> 01:03:28.114
Price?

01:03:30.117 --> 01:03:33.661
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

01:03:37.373 --> 01:03:40.917
One hundred souls.

01:03:41.001 --> 01:03:42.752
Three days.

01:03:43.254 --> 01:03:47.132
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

01:03:47.216 --> 01:03:50.343
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

01:03:50.386 --> 01:03:53.429
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

01:03:56.142 --> 01:03:58.183
Have you not met Will Turner?

01:03:58.226 --> 01:04:01.061
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

01:04:01.146 --> 01:04:03.522
Worth at least four.

01:04:03.565 --> 01:04:05.858
Maybe three and a half.

01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:09.653
And did I happen to mention...

01:04:09.737 --> 01:04:12.239
...he's in love?

01:04:13.074 --> 01:04:15.659
With a girl.

01:04:15.743 --> 01:04:18.162
Due to be married.

01:04:18.246 --> 01:04:20.246
Betrothed.

01:04:21.165 --> 01:04:25.918
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

01:04:25.961 --> 01:04:29.964
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony.

01:04:30.048 --> 01:04:32.049
Eh?

01:04:34.803 --> 01:04:39.724
I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls.

01:04:39.766 --> 01:04:42.434
But I wonder, Sparrow,

01:04:42.518 --> 01:04:44.769
can you live with this?

01:04:45.479 --> 01:04:49.316
Can you condemn
an innocent man, a friend,

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:54.404
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

01:04:57.617 --> 01:04:59.618
Yep. I'm good with it.

01:04:59.702 --> 01:05:02.871
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:09.167
Three days.

01:05:24.184 --> 01:05:27.143
- Uh, Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye.

01:05:27.186 --> 01:05:29.812
I feel sullied and unusual.

01:05:29.897 --> 01:05:35.693
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

01:05:35.778 --> 01:05:40.490
Fortunately, he was mum as to the
condition in which these souls need be.

01:05:40.532 --> 01:05:41.824
Ah.

01:05:41.909 --> 01:05:46.412
Tortuga.

01:05:50.416 --> 01:05:54.044
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

01:05:54.128 --> 01:05:57.381
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

01:05:57.465 --> 01:06:01.843
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

01:06:01.886 --> 01:06:06.390
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is the only
free port left in these waters.

01:06:06.474 --> 01:06:09.101
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

01:06:09.185 --> 01:06:10.851
An honest sailor is what I am.

01:06:10.936 --> 01:06:14.647
I make my living fair
and I sleep well each night.

01:06:15.357 --> 01:06:17.275
Sir!

01:06:40.548 --> 01:06:43.091
She wants you to do something.

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.888
She's trying to give a sign.

01:06:52.935 --> 01:06:54.435
Whoa!

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.732
Over there! Look for a sign!

01:07:04.529 --> 01:07:06.697
Look, there! There it is!

01:07:07.198 --> 01:07:09.742
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:12.911
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

01:07:12.996 --> 01:07:16.080
- That would be a bad sign.
- What's that over there?

01:07:36.393 --> 01:07:40.103
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

01:07:40.146 --> 01:07:41.938
I've never sailed a day in me life.

01:07:42.023 --> 01:07:45.233
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

01:07:45.276 --> 01:07:48.612
You'll do. Make your mark. Next!

01:07:48.696 --> 01:07:51.448
My wife ran off with my dog

01:07:51.491 --> 01:07:54.368
and I'm drunk for a month

01:07:54.452 --> 01:07:56.495
and I don't give an ass rat's

01:07:56.579 --> 01:07:58.622
if I live or die.

01:07:58.664 --> 01:08:01.707
- Perfect. Next!
- I know what I want...

01:08:01.792 --> 01:08:05.920
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow's-nest for you.

01:08:05.962 --> 01:08:08.130
- I know what I want.
- Next!

01:08:08.173 --> 01:08:10.257
Ever since I was a little lad,

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.844
I've always wanted
to sail the seas... forever.

01:08:13.929 --> 01:08:16.639
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

01:08:16.723 --> 01:08:19.016
Thanks very much.

01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:20.434
How we going?

01:08:20.477 --> 01:08:24.270
Including those four,
that gives us... four.

01:08:27.733 --> 01:08:29.901
And what's your story?

01:08:29.985 --> 01:08:32.487
My story.

01:08:32.530 --> 01:08:37.659
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

01:08:37.743 --> 01:08:41.371
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:44.331
The pursuit cost me my crew,

01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:47.042
my commission,

01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:49.294
and my life.

01:08:54.342 --> 01:08:57.594
- Commodore?
- Not any more. Weren't you listening?

01:09:02.183 --> 01:09:04.768
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.022
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.

01:09:10.107 --> 01:09:11.524
Lord.

01:09:11.567 --> 01:09:13.609
You didn't try to sail through it?

01:09:13.694 --> 01:09:16.237
So do I make your crew

01:09:16.321 --> 01:09:18.322
or not?

01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:21.993
You haven't said where you're going.

01:09:22.035 --> 01:09:24.036
Somewhere nice?!

01:09:24.121 --> 01:09:27.540
So am I worthy to serve

01:09:27.624 --> 01:09:30.375
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:09:32.879 --> 01:09:36.256
Or should I just kill you now?

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:44.598
You're hired.

01:09:44.682 --> 01:09:48.727
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:52.313
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

01:10:05.494 --> 01:10:07.495
- Time to go.
- Aye!

01:10:52.121 --> 01:10:53.872
- Thanks, mate.
- Aaah!

01:10:59.836 --> 01:11:01.170
Carry on.

01:11:09.054 --> 01:11:11.639
Come on, then! Who wants some?

01:11:11.682 --> 01:11:15.226
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:17.603
Come on, who's first?

01:11:20.273 --> 01:11:23.066
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

01:11:50.427 --> 01:11:53.137
James Norrington.

01:11:53.179 --> 01:11:57.057
What has the world done to you?

01:12:25.251 --> 01:12:27.544
Heave!

01:12:27.754 --> 01:12:29.354
Heave!

01:12:35.845 --> 01:12:39.306
- Heave!
- Heave!

01:12:42.226 --> 01:12:46.187
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner!

01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:51.400
Step to it!

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:59.575
- Step aside.
- Hey! Mind yourself!

01:13:00.035 --> 01:13:02.453
Let go, boy!

01:13:05.082 --> 01:13:07.249
No.

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:17.801
Haul that weevil to his feet.

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:26.893
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:32.106
- No!
- Impeding me in my duties?

01:13:32.148 --> 01:13:35.943
- You'll share the punishment.
- I'll take it all.

01:13:36.027 --> 01:13:38.487
Will you, now?

01:13:38.571 --> 01:13:43.784
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

01:13:47.539 --> 01:13:49.456
My son.

01:13:54.378 --> 01:13:56.754
He's my son.

01:14:07.891 --> 01:14:11.185
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:15.147
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

01:14:20.111 --> 01:14:22.612
No. No, I won't!

01:14:22.655 --> 01:14:25.449
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.

01:14:25.491 --> 01:14:27.659
Your issue will feel its sting,

01:14:27.744 --> 01:14:31.329
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.

01:14:35.168 --> 01:14:37.543
No.

01:14:37.627 --> 01:14:39.670
- Bosun!
- No!

01:15:23.838 --> 01:15:27.216
You had it easy, boy!

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:30.302
- Will.
- I don't need your help.

01:15:32.055 --> 01:15:37.059
The bosun prides himself on cleaving
flesh from bone, with every swing.

01:15:38.478 --> 01:15:43.439
So I'm to understand what you did
was an act of compassion?

01:15:43.524 --> 01:15:44.607
Yes.

01:15:51.573 --> 01:15:57.495
One hundred years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,

01:15:57.579 --> 01:16:00.498
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.

01:16:03.252 --> 01:16:07.254
Once you've sworn an oath to
the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

01:16:07.338 --> 01:16:09.297
Not until your debt is paid.

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:12.968
I've sworn no oath.

01:16:14.762 --> 01:16:16.930
You must get away.

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:20.100
Not until I find this.

01:16:21.769 --> 01:16:23.854
The key.

01:16:30.861 --> 01:16:33.279
The dead man's chest.

01:16:34.447 --> 01:16:36.615
What do you know of this?

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:41.370
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

01:16:41.454 --> 01:16:44.623
No, don't stab the heart.

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:49.711
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

01:16:49.795 --> 01:16:54.132
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

01:16:54.508 --> 01:16:57.093
So the captain has the key?

01:16:58.304 --> 01:17:01.014
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

01:17:01.098 --> 01:17:04.309
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.

01:17:07.479 --> 01:17:09.272
Captain Sparrow!

01:17:09.315 --> 01:17:11.815
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:14.610
I'm here to find the man I love.

01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:20.073
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

01:17:21.284 --> 01:17:25.329
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:26.788
Elizabeth.

01:17:26.873 --> 01:17:28.874
Hide the rum.

01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:32.627
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.

01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:35.379
- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

01:17:37.633 --> 01:17:40.843
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

01:17:40.928 --> 01:17:44.513
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but...

01:17:44.556 --> 01:17:48.267
...through an unfortunate
series of circumstances

01:17:48.352 --> 01:17:51.520
that had nothing
whatsoever to do with me,

01:17:51.563 --> 01:17:56.316
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.277
Davy Jones?

01:18:00.696 --> 01:18:03.073
Oh, please.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.660
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?

01:18:06.702 --> 01:18:08.870
You look awful.
What are you doing here?

01:18:08.913 --> 01:18:10.121
You hired me.

01:18:10.206 --> 01:18:12.457
I can't help it
if your standards are lax.

01:18:12.541 --> 01:18:14.209
- You smell funny.
- Jack!

01:18:14.251 --> 01:18:17.544
- Huh?
- All I want is to find Will.

01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:19.630
Well...

01:18:21.967 --> 01:18:26.470
Are you certain?
ls that what you really want most?

01:18:27.389 --> 01:18:29.723
Of course.

01:18:29.808 --> 01:18:34.061
Because I would think you'd want
to find a way to save Will most.

01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:38.564
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well...

01:18:38.649 --> 01:18:41.901
...there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.

01:18:41.986 --> 01:18:44.362
A chest of unknown size and origin.

01:18:44.405 --> 01:18:48.366
What contains the still-beating
heart of Davy Jones.

01:18:50.786 --> 01:18:52.620
And whoever possesses that chest

01:18:52.705 --> 01:18:56.749
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

01:18:56.792 --> 01:19:01.628
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

01:19:01.713 --> 01:19:05.340
You don't actually believe him, do you?

01:19:10.096 --> 01:19:12.431
How would we find it?

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.435
With this.

01:19:16.477 --> 01:19:19.438
My compass... is unique.

01:19:19.981 --> 01:19:23.149
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken."

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:28.612
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:33.617
Where does it point?

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:38.497
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:43.169
Oh, Jack.

01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:48.965
- Are you telling the truth?
- Every word, love.

01:19:49.008 --> 01:19:51.468
And what you want most in this world

01:19:52.344 --> 01:19:57.307
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

01:19:57.349 --> 01:20:02.353
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

01:20:17.994 --> 01:20:20.329
- Mr. Gibbs!
- Cap'n.

01:20:20.371 --> 01:20:22.539
- We have our heading.
- Finally!

01:20:22.624 --> 01:20:27.211
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

01:20:27.295 --> 01:20:28.504
Miss Swann.

01:20:31.548 --> 01:20:35.009
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

01:20:41.642 --> 01:20:43.351
There's something to knowing

01:20:43.435 --> 01:20:46.521
the exact shape of the world
and one's place in it.

01:20:46.563 --> 01:20:49.315
I assure you, these are not necessary.

01:20:49.358 --> 01:20:53.777
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

01:20:53.861 --> 01:20:57.489
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on Tortuga,

01:20:57.532 --> 01:21:01.493
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

01:21:01.536 --> 01:21:04.496
and other fugitives from justice.

01:21:04.539 --> 01:21:06.373
"Justice"? Hardly.

01:21:06.457 --> 01:21:11.253
Including the previous owner
of this sword, I believe.

01:21:12.754 --> 01:21:14.338
Our ships are in pursuit.

01:21:14.381 --> 01:21:17.550
Justice will be dispensed
by cannonade and cutlass,

01:21:17.592 --> 01:21:21.554
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

01:21:21.638 --> 01:21:24.431
I find it distasteful
to even contemplate

01:21:24.516 --> 01:21:27.643
the horror facing all those on board.

01:21:30.939 --> 01:21:32.815
What do you want from me?

01:21:32.899 --> 01:21:36.025
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

01:21:36.068 --> 01:21:39.737
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

01:21:40.739 --> 01:21:43.283
To you, you mean.

01:21:46.912 --> 01:21:49.664
Shall I remove these shackles?

01:21:52.918 --> 01:21:54.961
Do what you can for my daughter.

01:22:02.594 --> 01:22:07.514
So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

01:22:07.599 --> 01:22:11.351
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

01:22:17.150 --> 01:22:20.276
I wager... ten years.

01:22:21.153 --> 01:22:23.529
I'll match ten years.

01:22:24.489 --> 01:22:26.240
Agreed.

01:22:28.118 --> 01:22:31.954
Wondering how it's played?

01:22:32.039 --> 01:22:33.956
- I understand.
- Liar!

01:22:34.041 --> 01:22:35.791
It's a game of deception.

01:22:35.834 --> 01:22:39.587
But your bet includes all the dice,
not just your own.

01:22:39.963 --> 01:22:43.048
- What are they wagering?
- Oh, the only thing we have.

01:22:43.132 --> 01:22:45.467
Years of service.

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:51.806
- Any crew member can be challenged?
- Aye. Anyone.

01:22:54.685 --> 01:22:57.437
I challenge Davy Jones.

01:23:17.082 --> 01:23:20.042
I accept, mate.

01:23:31.637 --> 01:23:37.183
- The stakes?
- My soul. An eternity of servitude.

01:23:37.268 --> 01:23:39.519
No!

01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:43.189
Against?

01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:46.693
I want this.

01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:03.709
- How do you know of the key?
- That's not part of the game, is it?

01:24:06.879 --> 01:24:08.463
You can still walk away.

01:24:34.155 --> 01:24:37.240
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

01:24:37.366 --> 01:24:40.243
No! Don't do this.

01:24:42.204 --> 01:24:43.955
The die is cast.

01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:48.126
I bid three twos.

01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:50.420
It's your bid, captain.

01:24:56.718 --> 01:24:59.678
Four fours.

01:25:08.772 --> 01:25:09.938
Four fives.

01:25:12.067 --> 01:25:13.734
Six threes.

01:25:23.369 --> 01:25:26.537
Seven fives.

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:51.812
Eight fives.

01:25:57.443 --> 01:26:00.945
Welcome to the crew, lad.

01:26:02.989 --> 01:26:04.740
Twelve fives.

01:26:06.368 --> 01:26:08.035
Twelve fives.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.996
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:15.876
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

01:26:19.339 --> 01:26:24.217
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you
will spend an eternity on this ship.

01:26:26.137 --> 01:26:30.348
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore...

01:26:31.642 --> 01:26:34.769
...the very next time we make port!

01:26:42.361 --> 01:26:45.904
Fool. Why did you do that?

01:26:47.490 --> 01:26:49.658
I couldn't let you lose.

01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:52.536
It was never about winning or losing.

01:26:54.873 --> 01:26:56.331
The key.

01:26:58.042 --> 01:27:00.878
You just wanted to know where it was.

01:27:20.481 --> 01:27:23.107
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:29.237
Captain's orders.

01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:21.636
Here. Take this too.

01:29:22.555 --> 01:29:25.932
Now get yourself to land,
and stay there.

01:29:26.392 --> 01:29:29.686
It was always in my blood
to die at sea.

01:29:29.729 --> 01:29:32.772
It was not a fate
I ever wanted for you.

01:29:37.236 --> 01:29:41.238
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

01:29:41.323 --> 01:29:45.159
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,

01:29:45.201 --> 01:29:47.536
when I left you to go pirating.

01:29:48.496 --> 01:29:52.791
But it would taste a lie to say
it wasn't what I wanted.

01:29:54.502 --> 01:29:57.171
You owe me nothing, Will.

01:29:57.213 --> 01:29:58.422
Now go.

01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:03.301
They'll know you helped me.

01:30:04.637 --> 01:30:06.638
What more can they do to me?

01:30:12.478 --> 01:30:14.729
I take this with a promise.

01:30:14.813 --> 01:30:17.231
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

01:30:17.316 --> 01:30:20.234
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

01:30:22.738 --> 01:30:25.072
I will not abandon you.

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.242
I promise.

01:30:44.425 --> 01:30:46.425
- Beckett?
- Yes, they're signed.

01:30:46.468 --> 01:30:49.261
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

01:30:49.304 --> 01:30:50.763
Blaah!

01:30:50.806 --> 01:30:54.475
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

01:30:54.559 --> 01:30:58.729
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

01:30:58.772 --> 01:31:01.315
Of course.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:05.152
- He wants the chest.
- He did say something about a chest.

01:31:05.237 --> 01:31:08.863
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

01:31:08.948 --> 01:31:12.701
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

01:31:12.785 --> 01:31:16.454
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

01:31:16.539 --> 01:31:19.791
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

01:31:19.875 --> 01:31:22.001
Brace the foreyard!

01:31:22.086 --> 01:31:25.296
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

01:31:25.381 --> 01:31:27.340
- Persuasion.
- Friendly?

01:31:27.425 --> 01:31:29.092
Decidedly not.

01:31:29.135 --> 01:31:31.135
Will strikes a deal for these,

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:34.680
yet you were the one
with the prize... full pardon.

01:31:34.764 --> 01:31:37.307
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

01:31:37.392 --> 01:31:39.935
and the East India Trading Company."

01:31:39.978 --> 01:31:42.312
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

01:31:42.355 --> 01:31:44.857
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No.

01:31:44.983 --> 01:31:47.317
Persuade me.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:51.155
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:57.243
As I said, persuade me.

01:32:11.508 --> 01:32:14.009
It's a curious thing.

01:32:15.052 --> 01:32:18.096
There was a time I would have
wanted you to look like that

01:32:18.181 --> 01:32:20.724
while thinking about me.

01:32:20.808 --> 01:32:23.143
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

01:32:23.186 --> 01:32:26.104
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

01:32:30.777 --> 01:32:33.195
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancé

01:32:33.237 --> 01:32:37.198
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?

01:33:01.722 --> 01:33:05.016
Strange to come upon a longboat
so far out in open waters.

01:33:05.059 --> 01:33:08.520
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

01:33:08.562 --> 01:33:11.648
And what are we running from?

01:33:16.529 --> 01:33:19.280
That dress. Where did you get it?

01:33:19.365 --> 01:33:21.073
It was found aboard the ship.

01:33:21.157 --> 01:33:25.702
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

01:33:25.745 --> 01:33:29.164
- That's foolish.
- Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

01:33:29.249 --> 01:33:31.375
It brought good fortune.

01:33:31.417 --> 01:33:35.254
The spirit told us,
"Pull in at Tortuga,"

01:33:35.338 --> 01:33:37.339
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

01:33:37.423 --> 01:33:40.592
Off the books, of course.

01:33:40.635 --> 01:33:44.428
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

01:33:44.513 --> 01:33:47.431
- Why do you ask?
- Captain! A ship's been spotted.

01:33:47.474 --> 01:33:50.309
- Colors?
- She isn't flying any.

01:33:50.394 --> 01:33:52.395
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

01:34:03.198 --> 01:34:06.533
You will watch this.

01:34:14.625 --> 01:34:17.627
Let no joyful voice be heard!

01:34:19.714 --> 01:34:22.966
Let no man look up at the sky
with hope.

01:34:25.177 --> 01:34:27.636
And let this day be cursed

01:34:27.721 --> 01:34:30.723
by we who ready to wake...

01:34:32.392 --> 01:34:34.518
...the kraken.

01:34:34.603 --> 01:34:36.645
No!

01:34:53.579 --> 01:34:56.122
I've doomed us all.

01:34:56.498 --> 01:34:59.375
It's the Flying Dutchman!

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:06.758
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

01:35:06.842 --> 01:35:08.217
Must have hit a reef.

01:35:16.976 --> 01:35:20.020
Free the rudder! Hard to port
then hard to starboard.

01:35:20.063 --> 01:35:23.607
- Free the rudder!
- Hard to port!

01:35:30.865 --> 01:35:34.367
- Kraken!
- Kraken!

01:35:47.839 --> 01:35:50.841
Here it is! Take it!

01:35:50.884 --> 01:35:52.927
Take it!

01:38:04.804 --> 01:38:09.348
The boy's not here. He must
have been claimed by the sea.

01:38:09.432 --> 01:38:11.934
I am the sea.

01:38:15.647 --> 01:38:18.857
You need time alone with your thoughts.

01:38:18.942 --> 01:38:21.527
- Brig!
- What of the survivors?

01:38:27.033 --> 01:38:30.368
There are no survivors.

01:38:50.555 --> 01:38:54.432
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

01:38:54.517 --> 01:38:57.227
Get me there first,
or there'll be the devil to pay.

01:38:57.311 --> 01:38:59.146
"First"?

01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:02.440
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

01:39:02.525 --> 01:39:04.526
Who told him of the key?

01:39:07.655 --> 01:39:09.781
Jack Sparrow.

01:39:28.175 --> 01:39:30.509
My intuitive sense
of the female creature

01:39:30.594 --> 01:39:32.928
informs me that you are troubled.

01:39:35.014 --> 01:39:38.433
I just thought I'd be married by now.

01:39:38.517 --> 01:39:40.810
I'm so ready to be married.

01:39:48.444 --> 01:39:50.445
You know...

01:39:52.114 --> 01:39:57.492
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,

01:39:57.577 --> 01:39:59.453
and being captain of a ship,

01:39:59.495 --> 01:40:03.457
I could in fact
perform a "marr-I-age"...

01:40:04.292 --> 01:40:06.084
...right here.

01:40:06.127 --> 01:40:08.545
Right on this deck.

01:40:08.630 --> 01:40:10.631
Right... now.

01:40:14.219 --> 01:40:16.511
No, thank you.

01:40:16.596 --> 01:40:18.137
Why not?

01:40:18.222 --> 01:40:21.307
We are very much alike,
you and I. I and you. Us.

01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:26.437
Oh. Except for a sense of honor
and decency and a moral center.

01:40:26.939 --> 01:40:29.774
And personal hygiene.

01:40:30.817 --> 01:40:33.110
Trifles.

01:40:33.153 --> 01:40:35.780
You will come over to my side.
I know it.

01:40:35.822 --> 01:40:37.990
You seem very certain.

01:40:38.033 --> 01:40:41.117
One word, love. Curiosity.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.827
You long for freedom.

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:45.997
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.167
To act on selfish impulse.

01:40:49.252 --> 01:40:52.003
You want to see what it's like.

01:40:52.088 --> 01:40:56.508
One day, you won't be able to resist.

01:40:57.093 --> 01:40:59.344
Why doesn't your compass work?

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:04.348
My compass works fine.

01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:06.600
Because you and I are alike,

01:41:06.685 --> 01:41:09.979
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

01:41:10.021 --> 01:41:13.357
- To do the right thing.
- I love those moments.

01:41:13.817 --> 01:41:16.110
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

01:41:16.194 --> 01:41:18.696
You'll have the chance
to do something...

01:41:18.738 --> 01:41:21.782
Something courageous.

01:41:21.866 --> 01:41:25.034
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

01:41:25.119 --> 01:41:27.704
That you're a good man.

01:41:27.746 --> 01:41:30.290
All evidence to the contrary.

01:41:30.374 --> 01:41:33.376
Oh, I have faith in you.

01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:36.421
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

01:41:38.215 --> 01:41:41.217
Curiosity.

01:41:41.302 --> 01:41:44.262
You're going to want it.

01:41:44.346 --> 01:41:48.140
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

01:41:49.559 --> 01:41:51.727
You won't be able to resist.

01:41:53.062 --> 01:41:58.275
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

01:42:00.862 --> 01:42:03.697
I do want to know what it tastes like.

01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:05.824
But, seeing as you're a good man,

01:42:05.908 --> 01:42:08.200
I know that you'd never
put me in a position

01:42:08.243 --> 01:42:10.244
that would compromise my honor.

01:42:18.587 --> 01:42:20.671
I'm proud of you, Jack.

01:42:20.756 --> 01:42:24.467
Land, ho!

01:42:28.764 --> 01:42:30.513
I want my jar of dirt.

01:42:32.058 --> 01:42:34.976
- You're pulling too fast.
- You're pulling too slow.

01:42:35.061 --> 01:42:37.145
We don't want the kraken to catch us.

01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:40.148
I'm saving me strength
for when it comes.

01:42:40.232 --> 01:42:42.484
And I don't think
it's "kracken" anyways.

01:42:42.568 --> 01:42:44.694
I always heard it said "krayken".

01:42:44.779 --> 01:42:46.404
- With a long A?
- Uh-huh.

01:42:46.447 --> 01:42:50.325
No, no, no, no, no. "Krocken" is
how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

01:42:50.409 --> 01:42:52.159
and "kracken" is closer to that.

01:42:52.243 --> 01:42:55.746
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

01:42:55.789 --> 01:42:58.999
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

01:43:02.462 --> 01:43:04.630
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

01:43:04.714 --> 01:43:07.091
Don't touch my dirt.

01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:43.834
This doesn't work.

01:43:43.876 --> 01:43:46.711
And it certainly doesn't show you
what you want most.

01:43:52.343 --> 01:43:55.679
- Yes, it does.
- You're sitting on it.

01:43:56.556 --> 01:43:58.264
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

01:44:05.939 --> 01:44:09.024
- "Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
- I could join the circus.

01:44:09.067 --> 01:44:10.443
Mind if I shine your shoes?

01:44:14.865 --> 01:44:19.618
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

01:44:19.703 --> 01:44:21.703
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

01:44:21.787 --> 01:44:25.081
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:29.752
- Down, then!
- Down!

01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.487
It's real.

01:45:42.490 --> 01:45:44.574
You actually were telling the truth.

01:45:44.617 --> 01:45:48.203
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

01:45:48.287 --> 01:45:51.163
With good reason!

01:45:51.248 --> 01:45:53.666
Will!

01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:57.586
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

01:46:03.635 --> 01:46:05.761
How did you get here?

01:46:05.804 --> 01:46:09.807
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

01:46:09.849 --> 01:46:11.766
Not so easy, is it?

01:46:11.809 --> 01:46:14.477
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:18.648
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

01:46:18.732 --> 01:46:20.817
- What?
- What?

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.028
...I was reunited with my father.

01:46:24.113 --> 01:46:26.823
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.

01:46:27.324 --> 01:46:31.160
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

01:46:31.245 --> 01:46:32.786
Pretty much.

01:46:32.829 --> 01:46:35.205
Time and tide, love.

01:46:35.290 --> 01:46:37.541
Oi! What are you doing?

01:46:38.668 --> 01:46:41.003
I'm going to kill Jones.

01:46:42.005 --> 01:46:44.339
Can't let you do that, William.

01:46:44.382 --> 01:46:45.799
'Cause if Jones is dead,

01:46:45.842 --> 01:46:50.512
who's to call his terrible beastie
off the hunt, eh?

01:46:56.518 --> 01:46:59.854
Now, if you please.

01:47:00.522 --> 01:47:03.024
The key.

01:47:05.193 --> 01:47:07.903
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:11.365
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

01:47:11.408 --> 01:47:15.077
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:17.412
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

01:47:19.624 --> 01:47:23.585
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:26.838
I deliver it, I get my life back.

01:47:26.881 --> 01:47:29.883
Ah. The dark side of ambition.

01:47:29.967 --> 01:47:33.803
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:39.642
Stop it!

01:47:46.358 --> 01:47:47.816
Will!

01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:51.987
- Guard the chest!
- No!

01:47:52.072 --> 01:47:56.950
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...

01:47:57.035 --> 01:47:58.702
Oh, fine!

01:47:58.745 --> 01:48:02.580
Let's just haul out our swords and
start banging away at each other.

01:48:02.623 --> 01:48:05.249
That will solve everything! I've had it!

01:48:05.334 --> 01:48:10.296
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

01:48:12.925 --> 01:48:14.717
How'd this go all screwy?

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:18.137
Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

01:48:18.222 --> 01:48:21.349
Mr. Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honor,

01:48:21.433 --> 01:48:24.017
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

01:48:24.102 --> 01:48:28.230
then Turner there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

01:48:28.272 --> 01:48:31.942
'twixt him and his
twice-cursed pirate father.

01:48:31.984 --> 01:48:33.944
- Sad.
- This is madness!

01:48:34.028 --> 01:48:37.864
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

01:48:37.949 --> 01:48:39.825
Terrible temptation.

01:48:39.909 --> 01:48:42.160
If we was any kind of decent,

01:48:42.245 --> 01:48:45.955
we'd remove temptation
from their path.

01:48:51.586 --> 01:48:53.421
Enough!

01:48:56.883 --> 01:48:59.677
Oh. Oh!

01:48:59.761 --> 01:49:02.346
The heat!

01:49:21.323 --> 01:49:22.323
Bugger!

01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:38.130
By your leave, Mr. Turner.

01:50:16.667 --> 01:50:17.876
Aaaah!

01:50:25.051 --> 01:50:28.136
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.

01:51:20.228 --> 01:51:23.230
Do excuse me while I kill the man
who ruined my life.

01:51:23.273 --> 01:51:27.317
- Be my guest.
- Let us examine that claim a moment.

01:51:27.777 --> 01:51:30.279
Who was it,
that at the very moment

01:51:30.321 --> 01:51:33.240
you had a notorious pirate
safely behind bars,

01:51:33.283 --> 01:51:35.993
saw fit to free said pirate

01:51:36.077 --> 01:51:39.621
and take your dearly beloved
all to hisself?

01:51:39.664 --> 01:51:41.163
Eh?

01:51:41.248 --> 01:51:43.791
So whose fault is it, really,

01:51:43.876 --> 01:51:46.294
that you've ended up
a rum-pot deckhand

01:51:46.336 --> 01:51:48.296
what takes orders from pirates?

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:49.714
Enough!

01:51:52.634 --> 01:51:56.470
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!

01:51:58.432 --> 01:52:00.308
Still rooting for you, mate.

01:52:06.814 --> 01:52:08.899
Whoa! Oof!

01:52:11.068 --> 01:52:12.068
Oh.

01:52:58.489 --> 01:53:01.282
We got it! We got it! We got it!

01:53:15.672 --> 01:53:17.381
Hello, poppet.

01:53:45.534 --> 01:53:47.493
Come on, run!

01:54:30.285 --> 01:54:32.286
- Sword!
- Sword! Sword!

01:54:35.206 --> 01:54:37.790
Sword!

01:55:18.456 --> 01:55:21.123
Follow my voice. Follow my voice.

01:55:21.166 --> 01:55:23.459
To the left... no, turn around.

01:55:23.502 --> 01:55:25.586
Go to the right.

01:55:25.670 --> 01:55:28.339
No, that's a tree.

01:55:28.381 --> 01:55:29.757
Oh, shut it.

01:56:19.305 --> 01:56:21.723
Jar of dirt!

01:57:21.364 --> 01:57:22.656
Right.

01:57:56.981 --> 01:57:59.233
We've got it!

01:58:08.952 --> 01:58:11.954
Come on, Turner!

01:58:28.095 --> 01:58:31.722
Leave him lie! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.

01:58:32.724 --> 01:58:35.768
- We're not getting out of this.
- Not with the chest.

01:58:35.852 --> 01:58:37.853
Into the boat.

01:58:37.896 --> 01:58:40.021
- You're mad!
- Don't wait for me.

01:58:46.612 --> 01:58:50.740
- I say we respect his final wish.
- Aye!

01:59:00.126 --> 01:59:02.626
Your bravery is wasted.

01:59:04.004 --> 01:59:10.009
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.

01:59:12.262 --> 01:59:13.679
- Here you go!
- Oof!

01:59:25.774 --> 01:59:27.608
Pirates!

01:59:35.576 --> 01:59:37.035
Hey!

01:59:45.501 --> 01:59:49.087
- What happened to the chest?
- Norrington took it to draw them off.

01:59:49.172 --> 01:59:52.758
- You're pulling too hard!
- You ain't pulling hard enough!

01:59:52.842 --> 01:59:56.303
- Where's the commodore?
- Fell behind.

01:59:56.387 --> 01:59:58.555
My prayers be with him.

01:59:58.598 --> 02:00:00.682
Best not wallow in our grief.

02:00:00.767 --> 02:00:05.604
The bright side is you're back,
and made it off free and clear.

02:00:20.952 --> 02:00:23.287
Lord on high, deliver us.

02:00:26.541 --> 02:00:28.292
I'll handle this, mate.

02:00:30.628 --> 02:00:32.295
Oi, fishface!

02:00:33.756 --> 02:00:36.341
Lose something? Eh?

02:00:41.639 --> 02:00:43.598
Got it!

02:00:44.809 --> 02:00:47.852
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

02:00:47.937 --> 02:00:49.396
Look what I got.

02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:52.648
♪ I got a jar of dirt
I got a jar of dirt

02:00:52.690 --> 02:00:54.566
♪ And guess what's inside it? ♪

02:00:55.485 --> 02:00:56.985
Enough!

02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:07.830
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard!

02:01:07.914 --> 02:01:11.041
Brace up the foreyard!

02:01:14.211 --> 02:01:16.254
Hard to starboard!

02:01:16.338 --> 02:01:19.841
Send his beloved Pearl
back to the depths.

02:01:33.313 --> 02:01:37.190
She's on us! She's on us!

02:01:38.776 --> 02:01:42.863
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, captain.

02:02:08.722 --> 02:02:10.264
Make fast!

02:02:11.516 --> 02:02:14.059
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

02:02:14.144 --> 02:02:16.896
Come on, girl!

02:02:22.943 --> 02:02:25.403
- She's falling behind!
- Aye. We've got her!

02:02:25.446 --> 02:02:26.529
We're the faster?

02:02:26.572 --> 02:02:29.199
Against the wind,
the Dutchman beats us.

02:02:29.241 --> 02:02:31.743
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

02:02:31.785 --> 02:02:33.119
Aye.

02:02:35.664 --> 02:02:37.248
We're out of range!

02:02:37.291 --> 02:02:41.919
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

02:02:42.003 --> 02:02:44.421
We're giving up, sir?

02:02:54.474 --> 02:02:56.767
They're giving up!

02:03:02.857 --> 02:03:04.982
My father is on that ship.

02:03:05.067 --> 02:03:07.610
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.

02:03:07.653 --> 02:03:10.279
Why fight when you can negotiate?

02:03:10.364 --> 02:03:15.159
All one needs is the proper leverage.

02:03:15.244 --> 02:03:16.285
Oh!

02:03:24.711 --> 02:03:27.462
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

02:03:28.548 --> 02:03:31.800
We must have hit a reef!

02:03:33.928 --> 02:03:36.471
No. It's not a reef!

02:03:36.556 --> 02:03:37.973
Get away from the rail!

02:03:38.015 --> 02:03:41.101
- What is it?
- The kraken.

02:03:41.477 --> 02:03:43.728
- To arms!
- Load guns! Defend the mast!

02:03:43.813 --> 02:03:45.855
It'll attack the starboard.

02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:48.274
Run out the cannons
and hold for my signal!

02:04:21.849 --> 02:04:24.309
Easy, boys!

02:04:27.688 --> 02:04:28.730
Will?

02:04:29.231 --> 02:04:31.441
Steady! Steady.

02:04:33.401 --> 02:04:36.862
- Will!
- Hold. Hold.

02:04:36.946 --> 02:04:39.948
I think we've held fire long enough.

02:04:41.159 --> 02:04:43.535
- Will!
- Fire!

02:04:47.582 --> 02:04:48.957
Oh!

02:05:03.472 --> 02:05:04.472
It'll be back.

02:05:04.556 --> 02:05:07.224
- We have to get off the ship.
- There's no boats.

02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:19.986
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

02:05:22.323 --> 02:05:26.785
- Whatever you do, don't miss.
- As soon as you're clear.

02:05:40.965 --> 02:05:45.094
We are short-stocked
on gunpowder! Six barrels!

02:05:46.096 --> 02:05:47.971
Hurry up!

02:05:48.056 --> 02:05:50.099
There's only
half a dozen kegs of powder!

02:05:50.183 --> 02:05:51.934
Then load the rum.

02:06:00.776 --> 02:06:03.611
Aye, the rum too!

02:06:31.806 --> 02:06:33.807
Step to!

02:06:37.103 --> 02:06:40.063
Oh, you coward.

02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:45.860
Not good.

02:06:54.536 --> 02:06:57.538
- Haul away!
- Heave!

02:06:57.622 --> 02:07:02.001
- Heave like you're being paid for it!
- Put your backs into it!

02:07:45.043 --> 02:07:48.337
- I got you! I got you!
- Don't let me go!

02:07:48.379 --> 02:07:51.088
- I won't let you go!
- Shoot me!

02:07:56.345 --> 02:07:59.388
- Clear?
- Higher! Higher!

02:08:15.905 --> 02:08:18.406
Here! Come on!

02:08:19.075 --> 02:08:21.701
Come and get me. I'm over here!

02:08:21.744 --> 02:08:23.870
Come on!

02:08:48.812 --> 02:08:51.981
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

02:10:19.357 --> 02:10:21.274
Did we kill it?

02:10:21.359 --> 02:10:24.860
No. We just made it angry.

02:10:24.945 --> 02:10:28.322
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:32.910
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

02:10:35.205 --> 02:10:38.082
Jack. The Pearl.

02:10:39.334 --> 02:10:41.710
She's only a ship, mate.

02:10:41.753 --> 02:10:44.338
He's right.
We have to head for land.

02:10:44.381 --> 02:10:47.507
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:52.220
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.

02:10:54.098 --> 02:10:55.974
Abandon ship.

02:10:56.058 --> 02:10:58.476
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

02:11:15.201 --> 02:11:17.369
Thank you, Jack.

02:11:19.414 --> 02:11:22.207
We're not free yet, love.

02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:24.459
You came back.

02:11:27.005 --> 02:11:29.673
I always knew you were a good man.

02:11:42.728 --> 02:11:45.479
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:47.982
Come on, Will. Step to!

02:12:07.126 --> 02:12:09.627
It's after you, not the ship.

02:12:09.670 --> 02:12:12.630
It's not us.

02:12:12.673 --> 02:12:15.466
This is the only way, don't you see?

02:12:18.803 --> 02:12:20.971
I'm not sorry.

02:12:26.478 --> 02:12:28.479
Pirate.

02:12:47.873 --> 02:12:50.041
Where's Jack?

02:12:53.670 --> 02:12:56.255
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

02:13:06.015 --> 02:13:07.015
Go!

02:13:20.904 --> 02:13:24.365
Bugger. Bugger, bugger,
bugger, bugger, bugger!

02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:53.726
Come on!

02:13:58.983 --> 02:14:01.734
Just got it. Come on.

02:14:30.804 --> 02:14:32.221
Not so bad.

02:14:34.641 --> 02:14:35.725
Oh.

02:14:44.610 --> 02:14:46.360
Hello, beastie.

02:15:35.241 --> 02:15:39.410
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

02:15:40.829 --> 02:15:43.039
The captain goes down with his ship.

02:15:43.123 --> 02:15:47.168
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

02:15:52.424 --> 02:15:53.591
Open the chest.

02:15:56.177 --> 02:15:58.679
Open the chest. I need to see it!

02:16:14.279 --> 02:16:20.283
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

02:16:26.081 --> 02:16:28.874
The last of our ships
has returned.

02:16:28.917 --> 02:16:31.377
Is there any news on the chest?

02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:36.048
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

02:16:37.134 --> 02:16:39.342
He had these.

02:16:46.267 --> 02:16:49.436
I took the liberty
of filling in my name.

02:16:56.986 --> 02:17:01.071
If you intend to claim these, then
you must have something to trade.

02:17:01.114 --> 02:17:03.782
Do you have the compass?

02:17:03.867 --> 02:17:05.701
Better.

02:17:12.917 --> 02:17:15.377
The heart of Davy Jones.

02:18:10.847 --> 02:18:13.307
Against the cold...

02:18:13.392 --> 02:18:15.726
...and the sorrow.

02:18:25.987 --> 02:18:28.572
It's a shame.

02:18:28.657 --> 02:18:31.116
I know you're thinking that
with the Pearl

02:18:31.158 --> 02:18:34.911
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

02:18:36.664 --> 02:18:39.416
Doesn't matter now.

02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:42.085
The Pearl is gone,

02:18:42.169 --> 02:18:44.170
along with its captain.

02:18:44.213 --> 02:18:46.423
Aye.

02:18:46.507 --> 02:18:50.468
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

02:18:50.511 --> 02:18:53.679
He fooled us all right till the end,

02:18:53.721 --> 02:18:57.474
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

02:19:00.353 --> 02:19:02.104
To Jack Sparrow.

02:19:02.188 --> 02:19:04.857
Never another like Captain Jack.

02:19:04.899 --> 02:19:07.192
He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

02:19:07.777 --> 02:19:09.862
He was a good man.

02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:34.594
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

02:19:36.053 --> 02:19:39.014
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it? Hmm?

02:19:40.975 --> 02:19:44.186
What would you... Hmm?

02:19:46.772 --> 02:19:50.650
What would any of you
be willing to do, hmm?

02:19:51.861 --> 02:19:55.780
Would you sail to the ends
of the Earth and beyond

02:19:55.865 --> 02:20:00.951
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious Pearl?

02:20:07.083 --> 02:20:08.683
Aye.

02:20:13.256 --> 02:20:14.965
Aye.

02:20:17.969 --> 02:20:20.011
Yes.

02:20:22.306 --> 02:20:23.556
Aye.

02:20:23.599 --> 02:20:25.600
All right.

02:20:26.685 --> 02:20:31.648
But if you go and brave
the weird and haunted shores

02:20:31.732 --> 02:20:33.691
at world's end...

02:20:34.818 --> 02:20:38.446
...then you will need a captain

02:20:38.531 --> 02:20:41.114
who knows those waters.

02:20:56.005 --> 02:21:00.175
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?

00:13.666 --> 00:17.458
It has been seven months since Spain
began implementing European measures

00:17.541 --> 00:19.916
of dealing with
the scarcity of basic resources.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.625
The "Not Enough for All" plan
has begun to take effect,

00:23.708 --> 00:26.708
but for now, Spain,
as well as its neighbors,

00:26.791 --> 00:29.208
will be unable to sustain
dependent citizens

00:29.291 --> 00:31.583
without balancing out the resources.

00:31.666 --> 00:32.541
We--

00:38.500 --> 00:41.041
-This way.
-See you at the trucks. Careful, okay?

00:41.666 --> 00:45.083
-You! This way.
-Come on, quickly. Quiet!

00:45.166 --> 00:47.000
-Come on. Move it. Go!
-Go. Run.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.166
-Move it!
-Let's go, sweetheart.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.083
Come on.

00:55.291 --> 00:56.666
-Come on, hurry.
-What?

00:57.166 --> 00:58.000
Move it!

01:04.833 --> 01:05.666
Move!

01:07.041 --> 01:08.750
This way, come on. Quick.

01:09.708 --> 01:10.541
Let's go.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.166
-This way.
-Come on.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.000
This way.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.333
Come on!

01:19.500 --> 01:21.958
Mia, come on. No time to hang around.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.375
Come on.

01:26.708 --> 01:27.625
-You okay?
-No.

01:28.208 --> 01:29.208
Move, dammit!

01:33.750 --> 01:35.291
Go that way. You first.

01:35.375 --> 01:36.500
-Come on.
-Okay.

01:37.625 --> 01:38.541
Don't worry.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.958
-Nico!
-Here. I'm here.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.916
-I won't fit.
-Yes, you will. You will.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.291
-Push me.
-Come on.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.375
-Are you okay?
-What?

02:00.458 --> 02:02.125
-Are you okay?
-Hide!

02:08.708 --> 02:09.541
Follow me.

02:12.125 --> 02:13.208
Come on.

02:16.208 --> 02:17.041
Come on.

02:17.541 --> 02:18.583
Come on, sweetheart.

02:20.000 --> 02:20.833
Stay still.

02:23.791 --> 02:24.625
Come on.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.208
This way. Let's go.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.875
Attention! This is the police…

02:31.958 --> 02:34.875
-Stop right there. You're under arrest…
-Come on.

02:36.750 --> 02:37.583
Let's go.

02:39.083 --> 02:39.916
Wait here.

02:40.416 --> 02:41.458
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.208
You, here.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.083
Don't worry.

02:52.041 --> 02:52.916
What's wrong?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.625
The conditions have changed.
More risk, more money.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.750
No. We don't have any more money.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.208
That's not how it works.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.583
Sweetheart, give me your ring.

03:06.666 --> 03:07.625
-No.
-Yes.

03:07.708 --> 03:08.625
-No.
-Listen to me.

03:08.708 --> 03:10.833
Not the ring. We've given them everything.

03:10.916 --> 03:13.166
-We need to leave the country now.
-Here.

03:13.916 --> 03:14.750
Come on.

03:15.250 --> 03:17.333
Come on. We don't have all night.

03:18.208 --> 03:19.041
Follow me.

03:19.541 --> 03:20.541
Enjoy your trip.

03:24.625 --> 03:25.750
We're almost there.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.708
There it is. Our cruise ship.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.125
Move, dammit!

03:31.500 --> 03:32.333
Come on.

03:44.708 --> 03:45.791
-Are you okay?
-No.

03:57.166 --> 04:00.125
We supported the fight against shortages.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.833
We supported sacrifices
for the common good.

04:03.916 --> 04:07.500
We accepted it when they told us
the measures would be temporary.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.833
Now what? Look where they've driven us.

04:10.666 --> 04:14.000
First, they got rid of the elderly
in order to fight the shortages.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.541
Now, they're going after the children
and pregnant women. Don't you see?

04:19.125 --> 04:21.708
Children and pregnant women! This regime…

04:21.791 --> 04:22.708
Nothing else on?

04:29.041 --> 04:30.541
-Take it off.
-Okay.

04:34.916 --> 04:36.625
Let's see. Wow…

04:40.333 --> 04:41.375
-It's okay.
-Okay?

04:41.458 --> 04:42.416
-Yeah.
-Here.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.541
Your baby had better shut up.

05:05.291 --> 05:06.541
Where did you get this?

05:07.458 --> 05:08.291
Tell me.

05:08.833 --> 05:09.708
It's a secret.

05:11.125 --> 05:12.166
Don't eat it now.

05:12.666 --> 05:14.875
We have to save it for when we get there.

05:14.958 --> 05:16.541
-To celebrate, right?
-Yeah.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.125
Do you think the regime will get there?

05:25.208 --> 05:27.291
Ireland has always opposed it.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.833
Whatever.
All governments are falling for it.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.750
-You know something about the Irish?
-What?

05:33.291 --> 05:36.666
You can't defeat them. They drink stout.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.458
-Right.
-Ireland won't give in.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.791
It's okay to be scared, you know?

05:44.208 --> 05:45.708
It'll be fine. You'll see.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.625
-You don't know that.
-The worst is over.

05:49.708 --> 05:51.083
You don't know that either.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.083
I know something for a fact.

05:55.125 --> 05:55.958
What?

05:56.708 --> 05:58.666
I love you more now than yesterday…

06:00.000 --> 06:01.333
…but less than tomorrow.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.291
What is it? Have we arrived?

06:28.000 --> 06:28.875
We're leaving.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.458
No more games.

06:45.458 --> 06:48.333
Do you think she's pregnant
and traveling alone?

06:53.958 --> 06:55.875
If she's pregnant, she's not alone.

07:03.916 --> 07:05.541
How's our little Noa doing?

07:07.041 --> 07:08.208
You named her already?

07:08.291 --> 07:09.250
Noa.

07:10.583 --> 07:13.375
-What name would you like?
-I hope it's not a girl.

07:13.916 --> 07:14.750
I mean it.

07:15.666 --> 07:18.125
It's not a girl. It's a warrior.

07:19.125 --> 07:20.416
She kicks, just like you do.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.583
I can't feel her.

07:22.958 --> 07:23.791
What?

07:24.541 --> 07:26.541
It's been two days since I have…

07:29.250 --> 07:30.208
felt her move.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.708
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I don't know.

07:40.458 --> 07:41.416
What are you doing?

07:42.250 --> 07:45.833
Haven't you noticed she always kicks here?

07:47.375 --> 07:48.750
I think this is a foot.

07:50.041 --> 07:51.166
How do you do it?

07:52.750 --> 07:53.583
Do what?

07:57.166 --> 07:58.958
I don't know, you seem fine, as if…

08:00.375 --> 08:01.791
as if nothing's happened.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.833
You know that's not true.

08:06.875 --> 08:07.958
You know that, right?

08:14.625 --> 08:16.125
You brought my ducky!

08:17.541 --> 08:18.583
What's ducky saying?

08:28.791 --> 08:30.000
-Nico.
-What?

08:33.833 --> 08:37.250
What if she's alive,
and we're leaving her behind?

08:39.541 --> 08:40.375
Alone…

08:42.458 --> 08:43.291
She's gone.

08:44.750 --> 08:45.875
They took her away.

08:46.875 --> 08:47.708
She's dead.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.083
Open the doors!

09:26.625 --> 09:27.458
Hey!

09:28.208 --> 09:29.708
Nico!

09:29.791 --> 09:31.166
-Mia!
-Please!

09:31.250 --> 09:32.708
Quickly!

09:32.791 --> 09:34.208
-Get up here!
-Come on!

09:36.125 --> 09:37.791
-Stop!
-Nico.

09:37.875 --> 09:39.375
-Mia!
-Stop!

09:41.125 --> 09:43.208
Relax. There are lots of people.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.250
A truck's coming now.

09:45.333 --> 09:47.416
Half of you, get out, okay?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.041
Mia!

09:52.125 --> 09:53.541
Mia!

09:54.416 --> 09:56.166
-Nico!
-Mia!

09:56.250 --> 09:57.708
Come on!

09:57.791 --> 09:58.750
I want you out!

09:58.833 --> 10:00.375
You. Are you deaf?

10:00.458 --> 10:01.416
Come on, get down.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.666
No.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.375
-I was inside with my wife. Inside.
-Get out!

10:06.875 --> 10:07.750
Nico!

10:07.833 --> 10:08.791
Come on, out!

10:08.875 --> 10:10.125
No!

10:10.208 --> 10:11.666
No!

10:14.833 --> 10:16.041
You! Go to that truck.

10:22.958 --> 10:23.791
Nico…

10:24.375 --> 10:25.250
No…

10:32.375 --> 10:33.208
Let's go!

10:35.500 --> 10:37.583
Nico.

10:39.916 --> 10:40.750
Nico!

10:41.291 --> 10:42.750
Nico!

10:42.833 --> 10:43.666
Nico!

10:44.208 --> 10:45.333
107. Green.

10:45.416 --> 10:47.250
No! Wait!

10:54.208 --> 10:55.333
-Mia!
-Are you okay?

10:55.416 --> 10:57.333
Yes, I'm fine.

10:57.416 --> 10:58.833
-Okay. Nico…
-Yes?

10:59.458 --> 11:02.916
-How will we find each other?
-Relax. I'm in the truck behind.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.708
I don't wanna be alone.
I really don't wanna be alone.

11:05.791 --> 11:09.791
No. Listen to me.
Don't trust anyone. Okay?

11:09.875 --> 11:13.583
Keep your things safe. Your phone,
the food… Be careful, sweetheart.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.041
Did you hear me?

11:15.791 --> 11:18.541
Are you there? Mia! Please answer me.

11:18.625 --> 11:21.458
Listen, are you sure
they're taking us to the same place?

11:21.541 --> 11:23.791
Yes. As soon as they stop, I'll escape.

11:23.875 --> 11:26.000
There's only one boat this week,
and it's ours.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.208
-Nico…
-Yes?

11:28.333 --> 11:29.875
I want to be with you.

11:29.958 --> 11:33.375
Me too, sweetheart.
Everything will be okay. Don't worry.

11:33.458 --> 11:37.041
It'll be okay. We'll talk later.
I'll call you later, okay?

11:37.125 --> 11:38.416
Don't hang up on me.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.208
Sweetheart… We have to save
all the battery we can.

11:41.291 --> 11:44.375
-Don't hang up on me.
-We'll be together soon. You'll see.

11:44.916 --> 11:46.583
-Nico…
-Yes?

11:48.166 --> 11:49.916
-What is it, honey?
-Don't be long.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.625
-I won't. I promise.
-Okay.

12:26.791 --> 12:27.625
Quiet!

12:33.125 --> 12:34.875
Murderers!

12:36.625 --> 12:38.208
Murderers!

12:45.000 --> 12:46.500
GIVE US OUR CHILDREN BACK

12:46.583 --> 12:47.625
No…

12:59.375 --> 13:01.541
MURDERERS!
THIS IS NOT THE WAY

13:59.250 --> 14:00.083
What?

14:06.541 --> 14:08.500
-What is it?
-We have to go to the back.

14:09.791 --> 14:10.625
Be quiet.

14:31.666 --> 14:32.500
Hello there.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.041
Hello.

14:34.750 --> 14:38.416
-Get out of the truck. Bring your papers.
-Is that necessary? I'm late.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.750
-What are you carrying?
-It's all in the papers.

14:40.833 --> 14:41.958
Alright.

14:42.041 --> 14:44.333
-Can you come to the back?
-Yeah.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.166
-That's all you're carrying?
-Yeah.

14:57.791 --> 14:59.083
You don't know what it is?

15:00.208 --> 15:01.833
Not really. It's in the papers.

15:02.416 --> 15:06.458
I know what's in there, but you don't.
You don't know what you're carrying.

15:08.083 --> 15:09.666
I do a lot of runs…

15:10.208 --> 15:11.041
Stop!

15:11.916 --> 15:13.166
Is there a problem?

15:20.541 --> 15:21.750
Here's another truck.

15:22.750 --> 15:23.916
Keep going.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.833
Go ahead.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.125
Get him to pull over.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.583
Can I go?

15:36.208 --> 15:37.208
Are you in a hurry?

15:39.041 --> 15:41.208
If I'm late, I get penalized.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.916
Yeah, but I have to look inside.

15:44.791 --> 15:47.916
Is it necessary? I hardly have anything.

15:48.416 --> 15:50.500
Don't worry. I'll write your boss a note.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.666
Travis, stand over there.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.916
Now!

17:35.291 --> 17:38.041
Okay.

17:40.708 --> 17:41.541
Come on out.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.750
Don't be afraid. We're not gonna hurt you.

17:46.416 --> 17:47.541
Don't you want out?

17:57.583 --> 18:01.291
I know the measures against shortages
have been brutal

18:01.375 --> 18:03.458
towards children and pregnant women.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.625
I know it's hard to trust someone
on this side of the wall.

18:07.666 --> 18:09.541
But who have you trusted until now?

18:11.333 --> 18:14.333
The people who stuffed you in here,

18:14.416 --> 18:17.708
condemned you to suffocation,
and took all the money you had left?

18:17.791 --> 18:21.333
Those who promised you a better place?

18:22.958 --> 18:25.458
That better place does not exist.

18:25.958 --> 18:27.916
Come out, and you won't regret it.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.208
Otherwise, I have orders to shoot.

18:31.416 --> 18:34.833
Don't make me give that order, dammit.
I've done it too many times.

18:40.791 --> 18:41.666
Oh well, I tried.

19:00.833 --> 19:02.375
Give me your hand.

19:03.916 --> 19:04.750
Hey!

19:07.958 --> 19:09.250
Give me your hand!

19:10.166 --> 19:11.333
Kill them all.

19:42.791 --> 19:43.625
Doggy!

19:58.125 --> 20:00.833
Clean up all this shit
and gather their things.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.333
All done, boss.

20:22.416 --> 20:23.250
Good.

20:50.625 --> 20:51.458
Nico.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.250
Nico, hide.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.833
Hide. They killed them all.

20:57.291 --> 21:00.791
Hide. They killed them all. Hide.

21:57.916 --> 22:00.625
Hi, it's Nico.
I can't talk right now. Try me later.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.333
Nico.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.166
I'm at the port. Where are you?

22:17.750 --> 22:19.833
Where are you? Why won't you pick up?

22:21.208 --> 22:22.041
Pick up.

23:52.666 --> 23:54.125
This way, run!

24:05.500 --> 24:07.083
Watch out! It's coming loose.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.041
Okay.

38:22.666 --> 38:23.541
Hello?

38:27.625 --> 38:28.750
No signal.

39:07.916 --> 39:09.041
What?

39:09.125 --> 39:10.625
UNKNOWN NUMBER

39:12.208 --> 39:13.208
Mia, sweetheart.

39:13.291 --> 39:14.291
-Nico?
-Yes!

39:14.375 --> 39:15.208
Finally!

39:16.000 --> 39:19.041
-Thank goodness!
-I didn't know if you were still alive.

39:19.125 --> 39:20.250
-Yes.
-Are you okay?

39:20.333 --> 39:22.500
-I couldn't call. The battery died.
-Okay.

39:22.583 --> 39:25.916
The driver screwed us.
He abandoned us outside the city.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.750
-It'll take a while for me to catch up.
-Listen to me.

39:28.833 --> 39:32.208
-What is it?
-I'm trapped. I can't get out.

39:32.291 --> 39:35.500
-I'm coming to get you.
-No, wait, Nico. Listen to me.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.750
-I'm not…
-What is it?

39:38.625 --> 39:41.041
-I'm not on the ship.
-What do you mean?

39:41.125 --> 39:43.500
I'm not on the ship.
My container fell off.

39:44.958 --> 39:46.916
-Where are you?
-Floating in the sea.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.250
I'm floating. I don't know… I'm okay.

39:49.333 --> 39:52.708
But I don't know how long before
the water rises and the container sinks.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.750
Motherfucker! Can you see outside?

39:54.833 --> 39:57.166
Yes, I can see outside,
and all I see is water.

39:57.250 --> 40:00.333
-Nothing else?
-Nothing. I'm in the middle of the sea.

40:02.791 --> 40:04.458
Say something, anything.

40:04.541 --> 40:07.791
Don't worry, my love.
I promise I'm coming for you.

40:07.875 --> 40:10.333
-You have to hang in there, sweetheart.
-Nico…

40:10.416 --> 40:12.625
-Hang in there.
-I can't do it.

40:12.708 --> 40:15.083
-Do it for the baby.
-I don't think I can.

40:15.166 --> 40:17.416
-Yes, you can.
-I miss her so much, Nico.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.375
-No.
-I messed up again.

40:20.458 --> 40:24.083
Not that. Not now. It wasn't your fault.

40:24.583 --> 40:27.291
Do you hear me?
What happened to Uma wasn't your fault.

40:27.791 --> 40:28.666
Okay.

40:28.750 --> 40:32.250
You're the strongest person I've ever met.
Don't give up. Promise me?

40:32.333 --> 40:33.875
-Yes.
-Mia…

40:34.375 --> 40:35.208
Yes?

40:36.166 --> 40:39.750
-I love you more than yesterday.
-But less than you will tomorrow.

40:39.833 --> 40:42.583
I'll call as soon as I have a plan.
Keep the phone safe.

40:42.666 --> 40:44.583
-Okay, bye.
-I'll find you.

40:57.666 --> 40:58.916
Dad's on his way.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.250
Hold on.

41:00.750 --> 41:01.583
Not now.

41:02.291 --> 41:03.833
Hold on a little longer.

41:43.875 --> 41:44.958
What…

41:55.708 --> 41:56.583
No.

41:58.041 --> 41:59.666
No.

42:00.250 --> 42:03.958
Hold on a little longer, please.
Please, don't fucking do this.

42:04.041 --> 42:05.083
Please, not now.

42:09.125 --> 42:10.958
I asked you to wait!

42:16.458 --> 42:17.333
Nico!

42:18.208 --> 42:19.041
Nico!

42:24.791 --> 42:25.625

44:27.916 --> 44:30.083
Please, come on. Come on, breathe.

44:30.166 --> 44:31.166
Breathe.

44:31.250 --> 44:32.083
Breathe.

44:34.458 --> 44:35.291
No, please!

46:08.458 --> 46:11.875

46:15.333 --> 46:17.375
Hey there, baby girl. Hey.

46:18.166 --> 46:19.000
What is it?

46:20.583 --> 46:22.166
Want me to change your diaper?

46:25.666 --> 46:27.750
Okay, okay.

46:28.583 --> 46:29.416
Okay, sweetie.

46:29.500 --> 46:31.166
You have to eat, sweetie.

Come on.

46:35.625 --> 46:36.500
Please, come on.

Come on, sweetie. Why won't you eat?

46:41.916 --> 46:42.791
Come on, please.

46:43.375 --> 46:44.583
Come on.

46:44.666 --> 46:46.208
You have to eat, sweetie.

46:46.791 --> 46:47.666
Okay.

46:49.833 --> 46:50.666
Okay.

46:52.125 --> 46:53.250
It's okay, sweetie.

46:53.916 --> 46:55.458
But I need to eat.

47:10.500 --> 47:11.416
For fuck's sake.

47:12.291 --> 47:13.125
Shit.

47:20.375 --> 47:21.833
There, there.

47:23.708 --> 47:24.541
Come on.

47:25.041 --> 47:26.375
Come on, eat. Come on.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.250
Why won't you eat?

47:32.875 --> 47:33.708
Okay.

47:37.250 --> 47:39.125
Listen to me. Listen.

47:39.208 --> 47:42.166
You have to eat,
and I have to take care of you.

47:42.250 --> 47:44.208
We'll get out of here. I promise.

47:44.958 --> 47:46.625
Please, sweetheart. Come on.

48:09.166 --> 48:10.250
Okay, enough!

48:10.333 --> 48:13.166
Let me do this.
I have to do it to get out.

48:13.250 --> 48:15.333
And to get help. Enough!

48:15.416 --> 48:18.000
Please, enough. Be patient.

48:24.458 --> 48:25.291
Okay.

48:27.708 --> 48:29.583
I'm coming. Coming, sweetheart.

48:30.458 --> 48:33.500
Coming. Okay. Don't cry, sweetheart.

48:33.583 --> 48:36.291
Baby girl. It's okay.

48:36.375 --> 48:37.458
You have to eat.

48:40.416 --> 48:42.875
Did anyone ever tell you…

48:43.458 --> 48:45.208
Come on.

48:46.041 --> 48:47.041
Come on.

48:48.416 --> 48:49.416
Stop!

48:49.500 --> 48:52.833
Stop! Please, stop!
You have to eat! You're going to die!

48:52.916 --> 48:55.250
Do you want to die?

48:59.541 --> 49:00.375
Sorry.

49:01.041 --> 49:04.000
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry.

49:04.625 --> 49:06.458
It's not your fault. I'm sorry.

49:07.666 --> 49:09.666
I know. I'm sorry.

49:32.958 --> 49:33.791
Sweetheart…

No!

54:40.500 --> 54:41.333
It's okay.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.583
You're hot, right? Yes.

54:45.333 --> 54:46.458
That's better.

I'm right here.

57:00.125 --> 57:02.166
It's okay.

57:02.250 --> 57:03.083
It's okay.

57:05.083 --> 57:06.333
Hush.

57:07.083 --> 57:08.041
It's okay.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Go away!

57:20.583 --> 57:21.791
Go away!

57:40.791 --> 57:41.708
It's okay.

57:43.000 --> 57:43.833
I'm here.

57:44.333 --> 57:45.375
I'm here.

57:46.125 --> 57:46.958

Please, come.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.708
Come closer. Come. Let me see you.

Let's leave, please.

01:00:44.416 --> 01:00:46.291
Uma, I've missed you so much.

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:49.708
Why did you let them take me?

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.583
I'm sorry.

01:00:55.875 --> 01:00:56.708
I'm sorry.

01:00:57.791 --> 01:00:58.916
It was my fault.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.500
I just wanted to play with the airplane.

01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:07.791
I'm sorry. I messed up.

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:16.458
Uma.

01:01:21.041 --> 01:01:21.916
Don't go.

01:01:24.916 --> 01:01:25.791
I'm sorry.

01:01:28.291 --> 01:01:29.250
It was my fault.

01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:30.625
I messed up.

01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:34.916
I'm sorry.

01:01:39.416 --> 01:01:40.875
It wasn't your fault.

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.375
It wasn't your fault, sweetheart.

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.208
I'll get you out of here, okay?

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:18.250
Okay.

01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:10.666
Look.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.333
This is the sea.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:16.250
The sun and the sea.

01:05:17.375 --> 01:05:18.208
And the sky.

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:22.125
And way over there is where we're going.

01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:42.166
You feel better outside, right?

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:46.416
Yes, you're much happier
because you're in the sun and fresh air.

01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:48.458
Let's see.

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:09.250
Come.

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:12.166
Come here.

01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:00.666
Here… Come on.

01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:45.291
I'm fine. Don't worry.

01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:47.208
I'm…

01:09:08.166 --> 01:09:09.666
I can't.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:12.583
I can't.

01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:38.541
Don't worry.

01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:12.291
Come on.

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:13.958
Come on.

01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:15.958
Come on.

01:11:18.291 --> 01:11:19.125
Come on.

01:11:20.916 --> 01:11:22.958
Come on. Come.

01:11:26.125 --> 01:11:27.000
Come here, fishy.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.833
Come.

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:32.500
Come!

01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:55.125
Don't look at me like that.
You were desperate for a feed too.

01:12:07.166 --> 01:12:08.458
MAXIMUM

01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:13.041
DAY 9

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.875
Such a good girl. Good girl.

01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:55.208
Hi, sweetheart.

01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:18.958
Where are you?

01:13:19.625 --> 01:13:20.541
Call me!

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:22.583
Call me!

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:50.583
DAY 12

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:10.791
Look, that's me.

01:14:11.375 --> 01:14:12.208
At school.

01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:15.791
With the kids.
Did I tell you I was a teacher?

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.333
This is your dad.

01:14:18.416 --> 01:14:19.500
His name's Nico.

01:14:19.583 --> 01:14:21.708
Here he is, in the store.
Look how happy he is.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:26.166
We had to close the store down
because supplies got so scarce.

01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:29.291
In the end, we had nothing to sell.

01:14:29.791 --> 01:14:31.625
But people still went in to see him.

01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:36.541
That's why I know
he'll find a way to get us out of here.

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:37.458
Because…

01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:40.166
he always thinks of something.

01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:47.083
This is your grandma, Noa.

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:50.083
What do you think of that name? Noa.

01:14:50.958 --> 01:14:52.125
I think it's nice.

01:14:52.666 --> 01:14:54.750
It means "long life." It's also…

01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:57.291
the feminine of Noah.

01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:59.833
Noah's ark. They got there.

01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:02.541
They were saved. They got to shore.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.250
It's an animal story.
I'll tell you all about it.

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:13.125
This is Uma.

01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:16.041
You want to hear about her, right?

01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:23.500
You have the same eyes as her.

01:15:23.583 --> 01:15:24.625
Exactly the same.

01:15:25.416 --> 01:15:27.958
The same face when she was little.

01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.500
She wanted to be a pilot.
An airplane pilot.

01:15:31.208 --> 01:15:32.708
She'd say, "Airplane pilot."

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:35.375
You two would have got on well.

01:15:39.041 --> 01:15:40.541
What happened was…

01:15:44.166 --> 01:15:47.875
When the regime took over,
she and I had to lock ourselves in.

01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:51.166
Dad would go out to get food.

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.958
The thing is time went by, and…

01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:59.458
Uma wanted to go out because…

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.875
A little girl
can't be locked up for that long.

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:07.500
At home, there wasn't…

01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:14.791
There wasn't much space.

01:16:16.375 --> 01:16:17.333
So…

01:16:19.416 --> 01:16:22.000
She kept asking me, on and on.

01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:27.333
And one day we went out.

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:31.583
It was only for five minutes,
but they took her away.

01:16:41.041 --> 01:16:42.125
It was my fault.

01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:43.916
I messed up.

01:16:46.833 --> 01:16:47.666
I messed up.

01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:10.000
What is it? Are you okay?

01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:11.583
You're frozen.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.333
Okay.

01:17:34.333 --> 01:17:36.125
You're so cute with my hat.

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:38.500
It suits you.

01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:43.833
You'll be better tomorrow, okay?

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:45.875
Wrapped up.

01:17:47.583 --> 01:17:48.583
All wrapped up.

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:57.208
Did anyone ever tell you

01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:02.625
That no dream

01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:08.291
Has time or space?

01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:14.250
No possessor

01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:18.250
No one

01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:22.708
No one

01:20:06.166 --> 01:20:07.000
It's okay.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.625
DAY 12

01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:18.208
No…

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:21.041
MAXIMUM

01:21:05.166 --> 01:21:06.208
Nico!

01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:08.833
Come on, please.

01:21:08.916 --> 01:21:10.625
Please, please.

01:21:13.333 --> 01:21:15.583
-Nico!
-Mia!

01:21:16.083 --> 01:21:18.125
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, finally.

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:22.208
Finally, sweetheart.
I couldn't call you. There was no signal.

01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:25.416
My phone is broken. The screen is broken…

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.250
-Where are you?
-Listen to me.

01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:28.458
What's wrong, Nico?

01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:33.250
I can't come to rescue you.
You have to do it alone.

01:21:34.791 --> 01:21:37.791
Promise me you'll do it. Promise me.

01:21:38.958 --> 01:21:39.958
Nico, what is it?

01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:42.583
Please, don't scare me.

01:21:43.791 --> 01:21:45.083
Sweetheart, what is it?

01:21:45.875 --> 01:21:46.708
I'm…

01:21:48.833 --> 01:21:49.666
Nico…

01:21:50.208 --> 01:21:51.875
I'm hidden in a container.

01:21:52.916 --> 01:21:54.916
I got into a speedboat, but…

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:56.916
they found me, and…

01:21:57.791 --> 01:21:59.791
I managed to get away, but they shot me.

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:02.458
Are you hurt?

01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.083
I'm losing a lot of blood.

01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:06.916
What?

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:07.833
Sweetheart…

01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:10.083
What?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.666
I just wanted to say goodbye.

01:22:15.458 --> 01:22:16.791
I promise you I tried.

01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:20.541
I tried as hard as I could.

01:22:22.166 --> 01:22:24.333
I promise. I'm sorry.

01:22:25.208 --> 01:22:27.833
You were right. You always are. I was…

01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:29.958
too optimistic.

01:22:31.083 --> 01:22:32.708
It wasn't a good idea to go.

01:22:33.208 --> 01:22:34.666
-No.
-I'm sorry.

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.958
-No, Nico, listen.
-I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

01:22:37.041 --> 01:22:38.375
Listen to me.

01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:40.000
You saved us both.

01:22:40.666 --> 01:22:42.333
-Do you hear me?
-What?

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:44.333
You both?

01:22:44.416 --> 01:22:46.166
Yes, sweetheart, she's here.

01:22:48.666 --> 01:22:50.791
She was born. She's here with me.

01:22:53.166 --> 01:22:54.416
She's so beautiful.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.333
-She's beautiful?
-Yes.

01:22:56.416 --> 01:22:58.333
A little girl, right? I knew it.

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:01.500
-Are you okay?
-Yes, we're fine.

01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:04.041
-We're fine.
-I wish I was there.

01:23:04.125 --> 01:23:07.333
You are here, Nico.
You're here. You were always here.

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:08.916
You were at the birth.

01:23:09.916 --> 01:23:12.500
You were there
when I opened the container.

01:23:14.041 --> 01:23:17.916
Nico, I promised you I'd fight,
and I fought. I swear I fought.

01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:22.125
You're there when I sing to her.
You're always here with me.

01:23:22.208 --> 01:23:24.250
What? You sing?

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:25.916
Yes.

01:23:28.958 --> 01:23:30.875
My love… What's she like?

01:23:32.958 --> 01:23:35.791
She's just like you. She's beautiful.

01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:40.291
Strong and funny and she makes me laugh.
She looks after me. Just like you.

01:23:40.791 --> 01:23:43.458
What am I saying? She's right here.

01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.291
I'm going to put the phone close
so she can hear you.

01:23:46.791 --> 01:23:47.875
-Okay.
-Sweetheart…

01:23:48.458 --> 01:23:52.041
The voice you're going to hear
is your dad's. Talk to him.

01:23:54.583 --> 01:23:57.666
Hello, Princess. It's Dad.

01:23:59.458 --> 01:24:04.208
That guy who used to squeeze your foot
when you were in Mom's tummy.

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:07.541
Listen, my love…

01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:10.625
I have to tell you a secret.

01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:15.041
If things ever get complicated,

01:24:16.291 --> 01:24:17.250
close your eyes

01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:20.166
and snuggle up to your mom.

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:24.250
You'll see it's the best place to be.

01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:26.625
Always.

01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:33.541
Did you hear her? She's so clever.

01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:36.208
Her name's Noa.

01:24:37.083 --> 01:24:37.916
Noa?

01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:40.291
Are you sure?

01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:44.375
She looks a lot like a Noa.

01:24:44.458 --> 01:24:47.375
I can't think of a better name.

01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:50.958
Nico…

01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:52.750
What?

01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:55.750
Nico, I love you more than yesterday.

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.750
But less than tomorrow.

01:26:57.291 --> 01:26:58.833

01:27:19.041 --> 01:27:20.916

SHE'S BEEN SLEEPING ALL DAY

DAY 24
I CAN'T STOP THE WATER

01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:30.125
I HAVE TO LIVE UP TOP

01:28:14.333 --> 01:28:15.750
Hush.

01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:28.916
Noa!

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.500
Noa!

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.375
A seagull!

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:34.500
Do you know what that means?

01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:51.875
MAXIMUM

01:29:06.125 --> 01:29:06.958
Okay.

01:29:13.791 --> 01:29:15.083
What?

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:18.791
No!

01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:37.583
Okay.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:54.458
No.

01:29:56.916 --> 01:29:57.833
No fucking way.

01:30:32.166 --> 01:30:33.000
No!

01:31:49.708 --> 01:31:50.875
Noa!

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:54.833
Noa!

Noa!

01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:57.875
Noa!

01:32:02.916 --> 01:32:03.750
Noa!

01:32:09.125 --> 01:32:10.708
No, please.

01:32:11.916 --> 01:32:12.958
Noa!

01:32:14.291 --> 01:32:15.208
Noa!

01:32:20.833 --> 01:32:22.666
Noa!

Noa!

01:33:05.791 --> 01:33:06.625
I'm coming!

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:14.083
Noa!

01:33:25.708 --> 01:33:26.541
Noa!

01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:42.750
I'm here, sweetheart.

01:34:47.833 --> 01:34:48.875
Not long now.

01:34:52.166 --> 01:34:54.125
A little longer. We're almost there.

01:34:54.625 --> 01:34:55.958
I know we're almost there.

01:34:56.041 --> 01:34:58.000
We need to hold on a little longer.

01:34:58.500 --> 01:34:59.583
Just a little longer.

01:35:00.166 --> 01:35:02.000
We have to tell our story.

01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:06.666
I know they won't believe us.

01:35:07.958 --> 01:35:09.625
But we know it's true.

01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:14.250
We know we fought, right?

01:35:17.875 --> 01:35:19.500
We did all we could, right?

01:35:24.583 --> 01:35:26.083
You saved me, sweetheart.

01:35:28.458 --> 01:35:29.750
You saved my life.

01:35:34.208 --> 01:35:35.041
Forgive me.

01:35:35.875 --> 01:35:37.083
I was so scared.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.458
But you made me strong.

01:35:44.833 --> 01:35:46.500
I did all I could, right?

01:35:49.625 --> 01:35:50.458
Right?

01:35:51.041 --> 01:35:52.750
I did everything I could, right?

01:35:56.125 --> 01:35:57.666
I did everything I could.

01:36:01.125 --> 01:36:02.541
I did everything I could.

01:36:07.833 --> 01:36:09.041
Everything I could.

01:40:40.541 --> 01:40:42.166
My daughter? My daughter.

01:41:11.833 --> 01:41:13.750
No, don't take it off.

01:48:16.416 --> 01:48:20.291

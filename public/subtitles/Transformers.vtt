00:00:56.223 --> 00:01:00.562
There's a legend that precedes
the dawn of our civilization.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:05.132
A vile god,
so large and so powerful

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:09.102
that it consumed
entire planets as fuel.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.506
Few believed such a thing
could be true,

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:17.144
until the day we saw Unicron
with our own eyes.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.037
But he didn't just come
for our planet.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.239
He wanted
our greatest technology,

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:48.475
the Transwarp Key.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.981
And he sent his most powerful
henchman to collect it,

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.148
Scourge.

00:02:44.132 --> 00:02:45.465
More enemies are landing.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.035
We won't be safe
for long.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.235
Do we have the key?

00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:51.139
You must take it.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.807
Keep it hidden,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.910
so that it never falls
into the hands of Unicron.

00:02:56.044 --> 00:02:58.478
But, Apelinq, we can fight.

00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:02.416
No.
Protecting our Transwarp Key
is all that matters!

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.719
Go. Use it to escape.

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:06.688
What will you do?

00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:09.691
I'll hold him off.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.592
Buy you some time.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.293
Then I'm staying
with you.

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:15.395
This is my fight.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.534
Listen, if Unicron
were to get the key,

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:21.803
he could open a portal
through time and space

00:03:21.936 --> 00:03:24.706
with no end to the worlds
he could destroy.

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:28.810
It is now your time
to lead the Maximals,

00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:30.978
Optimus Primal.

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:57.205
So you're
this planet's great warrior.

00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:04.311
Mmm. You have
such a beautiful world

00:04:05.847 --> 00:04:09.684
filled with
an abundance of life.

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:14.254
Savory.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.491
My master grows hungry.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:23.430
Give me the Transwarp Key,
and he will spare your home.

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:27.068
We'd rather die
than let him reach
other planets.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:30.470
So be it.

00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:50.423
Benefits of serving
the almighty Unicron.

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:55.763
They never learn.

00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:58.733
You're too late,
Scourge.

00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:02.804
Your master will be trapped
in this galaxy forever.

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:09.544
No!

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.518
His sacrifice will be our oath.

00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:19.687
To preserve the key,

00:05:20.288 --> 00:05:22.056
no matter the cost.

00:05:30.698 --> 00:05:35.870
You let them slip away
with the Transwarp Key.

00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:40.508
Scour the universe
and find where
the Maximals have gone.

00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:45.412
When you acquire the key,
use it to bring me to you.

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:47.615
Yes, my lord.

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:53.921
Once I have the key,
I alone will reign supreme.

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:56.317
All right, baby, come on.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.019
Show me the money.
Show me the money.

00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:04.659
Here we go. There we go.

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:07.128
Yo, Sonic. Breakfast ready yet?

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:10.131
I ain't your butler, Kris.

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:13.134
Come on, man.
No names over the airwaves.

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:14.635
It's Tails.

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:16.504
Oh, my bad,

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:19.640
Kristopher Diaz
from 974 Wilson Avenue,

00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.509
Apartment 2-C, Brooklyn.

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:23.544
No real names.
They're listening.

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:27.081
Ain't no secret
government agencies
worried about us, Tails.

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:29.150
Now get your behind out here
while it's hot.

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:32.219
At least they got that
going for 'em.
Here, I ironed this for you.

00:07:32.353 --> 00:07:34.855
I already ironed it. What...
Like you cooked those eggs?

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:37.558
What you mean?
They're just...
seasoned.

00:07:37.692 --> 00:07:39.994
Aw, come on.

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:41.329
Come eat, bro.

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:43.731
I can't get past Bowser.

00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:45.333
Well, good morning
to you too.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.234
Drink this
and take your medicine.

00:07:47.368 --> 00:07:49.337
- All of it.
- Okay.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.771
Are you sure you can take him?

00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:53.341
Yeah, uh, hospital's
on the way. I got time.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.444
And, if that lady,
that administrator, is there

00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:58.079
and she mentions a bill,

00:07:58.212 --> 00:07:59.213
just...

00:08:00.014 --> 00:08:02.216
tell her we're handling it.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.553
I will. And after today,
I'll be able to help out more.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.722
Good luck on the interview.

00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:10.424
Don't forget to laugh
at all their jokes.

00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:13.294
White people love that shit.
Ma, language.

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:17.198
Okay!
Remember, I have class tonight, so I'll be home late.

00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:18.733
Los quiero.
I love you.

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:21.635
Hurry up, man.
We gotta get into the city.

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:27.308
Hey. Hold up. Hold up.

00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:29.143
Your hand's hurting again?

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:31.879
No, it's nothing.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.881
Yo, let me see.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.752
Kris.

00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:42.857
It's swollen.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.793
The sickle cells
must be blocking
the blood flow again.

00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:47.428
How long has this
been going on?

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:49.130
Couple days.

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:51.766
Hey, yo, look, I told you,

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:53.267
you gotta tell me
these things.

00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:56.303
You fighting this alone,
or we fighting it together?

00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:58.939
Together.

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:01.542
Home team?

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:02.676
Home team.

00:09:09.784 --> 00:09:12.219
Two for ten. Two for...
Stop touching everything.

00:09:12.353 --> 00:09:14.221
Oh, hell, no.
Kris, what'd I tell you

00:09:14.355 --> 00:09:17.491
about letting your mans
come out the crib looking
like a whole square?

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:19.493
Only so much I can do.

00:09:19.627 --> 00:09:21.395
Yeah, whatever, bro.
Look. Here.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.631
Ooh! My dawg!

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:27.334
When you gonna let me
put your skills to work
and get you some real money?

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:29.703
Yeah. Says the dude
who can't even afford cable.

00:09:29.837 --> 00:09:31.105
"Says the guy who..."

00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:33.074
I choose
not to purchase cable.

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:35.876
It's my own personal way
to protest the vampiric nature

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.845
of modern-day capitalism!

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.414
Hey, good luck
with that interview
in that dusty suit!

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:05.673
Ugh! I'm coming.

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.141
Hey, guys. That's a good one,

00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:09.410
but the Ankylosaurus
was an armored dinosaur.

00:10:23.592 --> 00:10:26.427
- Thank you, thank you...
- ...for being patient.

00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:27.895
Intern? Intern?

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.532
I paged you three times.
Why didn't you call me?

00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:33.868
Okay, well, I figured
if I stopped to call,
that would make me later.

00:10:34.001 --> 00:10:36.403
The police are here.

00:10:36.538 --> 00:10:38.105
They busted an art auction.

00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:40.875
The owner claims
that everything is authentic,

00:10:41.008 --> 00:10:43.811
but they want
a second opinion.

00:10:45.146 --> 00:10:46.180
All right.

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:51.352
The da Vinci sketch is legit.

00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:52.853
The painting's a copy.

00:10:52.987 --> 00:10:55.189
Real one's at
the National Gallery
in London.

00:10:56.558 --> 00:10:58.092
Roman vase.

00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:01.729
Valuable, but you are not
gonna retire off of them.

00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:06.834
This Greek curse tablet,
it would be expensive,

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:08.269
but it's a fake.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:09.703
How can you tell?

00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:12.206
See the spelling? Roman.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.175
Doesn't even show up
in that era.

00:11:14.308 --> 00:11:15.743
Got it.

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:19.246
Officers,
I figured it out. So...

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.350
The da Vinci,
that is real.

00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:34.428
Hmm.
Now, where did you come from?

00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:50.344
What are you?

00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:53.247
It's pretty neat, right?
Yes.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.182
Where is it from?

00:11:55.316 --> 00:11:57.084
They just discovered it
in Sudan.

00:11:57.218 --> 00:12:01.055
The boys say it's Horus,
fifth millennia BC, Nubian?

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:04.191
This symbol is definitely
not hieroglyphic.

00:12:04.325 --> 00:12:06.961
Well, if it's as exotic
as it looks,

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:09.196
I'm gonna get a feature
in Minerva.

00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:12.032
Uh, Jillian?

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:16.203
Okay, team, let's do it.

00:12:34.522 --> 00:12:35.624
Okay, what are the rules?

00:12:37.024 --> 00:12:38.892
Bros before hos.

00:12:41.663 --> 00:12:42.731
"Don't be a problem.

00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:44.164
Don't go looking
for a problem."

00:12:44.298 --> 00:12:46.467
- Or else we're gonna...
- Have a problem.

00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.702
I know, I know.

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:49.436
Okay, I'll be back
in a little bit.

00:12:56.176 --> 00:12:58.045
Mr. Diaz?

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.215
Hey, I know we're
a little behind on the bill.

00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:04.485
Three months behind.
Until your account is current,
you can't bring your brother.

00:13:04.619 --> 00:13:06.253
I've told you that.
I'm gonna fix it.

00:13:06.387 --> 00:13:08.623
I need a little more time.
Take him to the ER.

00:13:08.757 --> 00:13:11.492
Well, they won't
see him in the ER
unless he's critical.

00:13:11.626 --> 00:13:13.260
Mr. Diaz.
He's 11!

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.063
He's 11 years old.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.101
Come on, Kris,
we gotta go.

00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:24.238
What happened?
I'll tell you later, man.
All right?

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:25.873
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

00:13:29.544 --> 00:13:30.578
Hey, yo. Sit here.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.848
And don't move!

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:38.052
After
a conference with Simpson's
attorney, Howard Weitzman...

00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:39.987
Can I help you?
Yes.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.489
Hey, I'm here for an interview
with the head of security,
Mr. Bishop.

00:13:42.624 --> 00:13:44.091
I'm Noah Diaz.

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:46.594
It's been canceled.
No. No, that has
to be a mistake.

00:13:46.728 --> 00:13:48.495
Came right from Mr. Bishop.

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:52.534
Just need your authorization...

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:54.201
Mr. Bishop! Hey! Hey!

00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:56.604
It's okay, Walker.

00:13:56.738 --> 00:13:59.973
It's me, Noah Diaz.
Sir, I think your boy
back there is confused.

00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:02.276
He said our interview
was canceled.
Because it is.

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:05.012
Wait, why?
On the phone you said
I was perfect for the job.

00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:06.614
You said this
was just a formality.

00:14:06.748 --> 00:14:09.283
It was until
your old commanding officer
called me back.

00:14:09.416 --> 00:14:12.886
Said you were brave,
an expert comtech,
but unreliable.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.254
Couldn't trust you.

00:14:14.388 --> 00:14:16.123
Your head was always
somewhere else.

00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:17.891
Sir, I can explain
all of that.

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:20.394
I had some
responsibilities at home.
My brother, he's sick...

00:14:20.528 --> 00:14:22.896
You had a responsibility
to the United States Army.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.998
Mr. Bishop! Sir.

00:14:25.132 --> 00:14:27.968
I'm a hard worker, okay?
I just...

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:31.071
I just really
need a break.

00:14:31.205 --> 00:14:35.476
Listen,
I can't have someone like you
mess up what I've built.

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:37.878
Someone like me?

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.586
You don't know anything
about me!

00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:47.589
I know you don't know
how to be part of a team.

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:51.325
God.

00:14:52.594 --> 00:14:53.494
Hey, look.

00:14:53.628 --> 00:14:55.162
Superman went
on a bunch of interviews

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:58.198
before he got his job
on the Daily Planet.

00:14:58.332 --> 00:15:01.068
But he never gave up.
I'm not Superman, Kris.

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:02.469
Life ain't a comic book.

00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:04.972
I'm just saying.
You'll get the next one.

00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:07.107
Yo, there is no next one.

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:09.977
No one's coming to save us.
We're alone in this.

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:20.254
Yo, man, I'm sorry.

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:21.989
It's all right.

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:23.525
No, it's not.

00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:28.530
None of this is.

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.404
You know what?

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.440
Come on.

00:15:41.643 --> 00:15:43.410
Yo, here, bro.

00:15:43.545 --> 00:15:46.113
Just head upstairs.
I'll be right there,
all right?

00:15:51.084 --> 00:15:52.720
So what was you
talking about earlier?

00:16:12.874 --> 00:16:13.942
Hey, yo, you want one?

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:16.176
No. I don't want any candy.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.111
You gotta relax, man.

00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:20.180
Your energy
is really affecting my chi.

00:16:20.314 --> 00:16:22.617
And I get it.
I was nervous
my first time too.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.753
But you might want to do
some breathing exercises,
or something. Look at me.

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:33.994
My man, my man,
my man, my man.

00:16:34.796 --> 00:16:37.431
It's just
I ain't done this before.

00:16:37.565 --> 00:16:40.234
I know that.
But them rich cats in there,

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:42.302
they give a ton of paper
to charities every year

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:44.104
to make themselves
feel better.

00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:47.575
If you look at it
from a holistic perspective,
we doing them a favor.

00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:51.513
Hey, yo!
You're welcome!
Will you stop?

00:16:51.646 --> 00:16:55.148
What are you doing?
This ain't about to affect
they pockets at all.

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:56.718
And it's about
to be easy as hell.

00:16:56.851 --> 00:16:59.319
So why you ain't the one
going in there and doing it?

00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:01.890
Because, papito,
I'm the mastermind.

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:04.592
Now come on,
put this in your ear.

00:17:04.726 --> 00:17:07.194
My man, you serious?
Yo, is that even clean?

00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:11.131
It's the fourth quarter,
we got about ten seconds
left on the clock,

00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:13.200
and you got the rock.

00:17:13.835 --> 00:17:15.369
Get rid of this.
Hey, man!

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:19.039
Don't slam the...

00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:27.180
Okay. I am off
to my fundraiser.

00:17:27.314 --> 00:17:29.483
What do you think?
It's nice.

00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:33.621
Um, can I...
Can I run something by you?

00:17:36.691 --> 00:17:38.492
So I've been doing
some research,

00:17:38.626 --> 00:17:41.663
and I don't think
that the statuette is Horus.

00:17:41.796 --> 00:17:43.965
As a matter of fact,
I'm sure it's not.

00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:46.768
The boys dated it
around 5000 BC, right?

00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:48.235
Mm-hmm.

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:49.604
But the Nubians,

00:17:49.737 --> 00:17:51.405
they never even had contact
with the Egyptians

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:53.340
until 600 years after that.

00:17:53.473 --> 00:17:55.009
The symbol's
not hieroglyphic.

00:17:55.142 --> 00:17:57.144
I don't even think
it's from that part
of the world.

00:17:57.277 --> 00:17:59.614
I think it might
be Aztec or Inca.

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:04.418
It's not some Egyptian god.
It's something else.

00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:11.091
Interesting.

00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:12.627
Get those pressed, okay?

00:18:34.749 --> 00:18:36.517
Yeah.

00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:40.187
There you go.
Let that breath fill you up.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.024
In... out.

00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:44.892
Please stop talking.

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:47.829
Okay, all right, I get it,
you don't like to chitchat
back and forth.

00:18:47.962 --> 00:18:49.097
But I got something for you.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.268
You got a robbing mixtape?

00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:56.336
Uh, no.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.206
I got a liberating mixtape.

00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:13.253
You feeling that, huh?

00:19:13.387 --> 00:19:14.589
Yeah, whatever.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.798
All right,
there shouldn't be nobody
in this part of the building.

00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:26.366
You should be able
to just waltz right on in.

00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:32.339
Strike one, mastermind.
This place is packed.

00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:34.575
Hey, well,
to error is divine.

00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:36.476
Just act like you own
the place.

00:19:36.611 --> 00:19:39.179
Hey, wassup, brother?
Good to see you again.

00:19:39.312 --> 00:19:41.649
Try not to look suspicious.

00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:47.055
Here you go. Here you go.
Sorry. Sorry. That's you, bro.

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.891
Nice glasses. I didn't know...
I didn't know you had glasses.

00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:52.459
What are you doing,
making friends?

00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:03.236
Everything good?
We're in the mix.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.243
Hey. Let's see
what you really are.

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:23.191
Now, my man said
it's tucked in the back.

00:20:23.323 --> 00:20:24.959
Been there a couple weeks.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.729
It's like a grayish car

00:20:27.862 --> 00:20:28.963
with like a...

00:20:29.097 --> 00:20:30.565
Blue stripe.

00:20:46.214 --> 00:20:48.850
All right, now just
like brother Reek showed you.

00:20:48.983 --> 00:20:50.017
Down the window...

00:20:51.552 --> 00:20:52.587
...a little wiggle...

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.656
...feel that snag and...

00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:58.192
...yeah.

00:20:58.325 --> 00:21:00.260
Now we making money.

00:21:25.153 --> 00:21:26.486
All right.
Talk to me, homey.

00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:27.555
I'm in.

00:21:27.688 --> 00:21:28.790
This won't hurt a bit.

00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:46.874
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.747
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:21:57.752 --> 00:22:00.788
I'm gonna lose my job.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.826
I'm gonna go to jail.

00:22:21.542 --> 00:22:23.911
It's definitely not Nubian.

00:23:01.582 --> 00:23:03.684
This cannot be.

00:23:03.818 --> 00:23:06.754
Calling all Autobots!
Calling all Autobots!

00:23:06.888 --> 00:23:08.455
Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

00:23:14.896 --> 00:23:17.464
Prime, this is Arcee.
I have a visual.

00:23:17.598 --> 00:23:19.033
What am I looking at?

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.969
A way home.

00:23:26.707 --> 00:23:28.542
Calling all Autobots!

00:23:28.676 --> 00:23:30.878
Calling all Autobots!

00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:37.652
- What am I doing?
- Well, the coast is clear out here,

00:23:37.785 --> 00:23:40.388
so whenever you want to slide
that thing on out, you good.

00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:41.956
I can't. I can't.

00:23:42.089 --> 00:23:44.058
Like you can't
drive stick or something?

00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:46.761
No, it's just...
I ain't no thief.

00:23:46.894 --> 00:23:48.930
Are you having
an existential crisis now?

00:23:49.063 --> 00:23:51.198
The deadline for that was
when I offered you Twizzlers.

00:23:51.332 --> 00:23:52.934
This is an emergency.

00:23:53.067 --> 00:23:55.102
Can you hear me, Mirage?
Roll out!

00:23:55.236 --> 00:23:56.804
Who the hell was that?

00:23:56.938 --> 00:23:59.273
That's the radio, bro.
This car is buggin'. I'm out.

00:24:01.509 --> 00:24:02.710
Hey!

00:24:03.344 --> 00:24:04.278
Shit!

00:24:04.412 --> 00:24:06.347
Oh, shit.
Hey, you!

00:24:08.082 --> 00:24:10.318
Get out of the car!

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.621
I'm trying!
The car started by itself,
I promise!

00:24:13.754 --> 00:24:15.356
Look, it's not working!
Get out now!

00:24:24.231 --> 00:24:26.100
No! Wait! What you doing?

00:24:26.233 --> 00:24:27.335
Noah, what's...

00:24:30.538 --> 00:24:32.873
Reek! Reek! Reek!

00:24:33.007 --> 00:24:34.976
Now, that's top-tier
manifestation!

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.179
Yo, the car's driving
by itself!

00:24:40.314 --> 00:24:41.415
Noah, you good?

00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:42.717
I don't know
what's going on!

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.085
It won't stop!

00:24:44.218 --> 00:24:46.354
Yo, stop! Stop!
Why aren't you listening?

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.923
You might wanna slow down.
It's not me, it's the car!

00:24:49.056 --> 00:24:50.658
- It's possessed!
- No, no, no.

00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:52.460
You're just
on an adrenaline high.

00:24:52.593 --> 00:24:54.428
Let's do some of them
breathing exercises.

00:24:55.896 --> 00:24:57.631
Yo, I don't need
no breathing exercises!

00:24:57.765 --> 00:24:58.933
The car's driving by itself!

00:25:00.935 --> 00:25:02.503
Oh, snap.

00:25:02.636 --> 00:25:04.438
Yo, Reek, what do we do?

00:25:04.572 --> 00:25:06.440
Noah, I cannot hear you.

00:25:06.574 --> 00:25:08.209
Reek!
Noah, I can't...

00:25:10.411 --> 00:25:13.481
No, he did not!
No, he did not just leave me!

00:25:16.183 --> 00:25:18.185
Pull over!
Help me!

00:25:51.619 --> 00:25:52.820
Oh! Are you ok...

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.396
Drive. Drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive!

00:26:15.943 --> 00:26:18.312
The bridge.
The bridge, the bridge...

00:26:18.446 --> 00:26:19.514
Take the Williamsburg!

00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:31.092
I got a 10-37 in progress.
Silver Porsche.

00:26:33.528 --> 00:26:35.062
You serious, man?

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.736
Oh, nah. Oh, nah.

00:26:50.545 --> 00:26:52.246
Hell, do something, please!

00:27:04.959 --> 00:27:08.762
Yo, nah. Nah, nah, nah.

00:27:14.702 --> 00:27:15.936
Come in, come in.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.172
Can you hear me, Mirage?
Mir-what?

00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:32.987
Oh, Mirage.

00:27:54.108 --> 00:27:56.744
Yo, yo, yo, slow down!
Slow down!

00:28:07.788 --> 00:28:11.292
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
That felt good!

00:28:11.425 --> 00:28:15.062
Get some oil pumping,
you know? Damn!

00:28:15.196 --> 00:28:16.830
I've been cooped up
forever, dude.

00:28:16.964 --> 00:28:18.866
I can't tell you
how old it gets!

00:28:18.999 --> 00:28:20.868
"Mirage, stay hidden.

00:28:21.001 --> 00:28:23.804
Mirage, don't draw
any attention to yourself.

00:28:23.938 --> 00:28:29.009
Mirage, Big is just a movie.
You'll never be a real boy."

00:28:29.143 --> 00:28:31.812
But that was fun, man.
You're fun, dude.

00:28:31.946 --> 00:28:35.783
Oh, right. This is probably
a lot for you, huh?

00:28:37.418 --> 00:28:40.387
Back up!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's with the aggression?

00:28:40.522 --> 00:28:42.657
I thought
after the car chase,
we were boys.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.925
Are you gonna hit me?
Maybe.

00:28:45.059 --> 00:28:48.462
It's like that?

00:28:51.432 --> 00:28:53.434
Hmm. Tough guy.

00:28:53.568 --> 00:28:56.303
I like that.
I like it a lot.

00:28:56.437 --> 00:28:57.905
What are you?

00:28:58.038 --> 00:28:59.940
Some sort of possessed car
or something?

00:29:00.074 --> 00:29:02.544
Nah.
That's not real, man.

00:29:02.677 --> 00:29:03.612
I'm an alien.

00:29:03.744 --> 00:29:05.647
Like... Like E.T.?

00:29:05.779 --> 00:29:07.982
E.T.? The little ugly guy
in the basket?

00:29:08.115 --> 00:29:10.985
Look at this face!
The name's Mirage.

00:29:13.153 --> 00:29:15.022
Come on. Give me a little,
give me a little.

00:29:15.155 --> 00:29:16.725
Give me a little.
Give a little tap.

00:29:16.857 --> 00:29:17.992
Give me a little tap.

00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:19.994
There you go.
Now we're friends!

00:29:20.127 --> 00:29:22.997
Oh, great. The gang's here.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.066
There are more like you?
Like me? Nah.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.636
But be cool
so they don't crush you.

00:29:27.768 --> 00:29:30.471
What?
Yeah, I'd put that pipe down
if I were you.

00:29:58.932 --> 00:30:02.202
Well, well,
who have we got here?

00:30:06.874 --> 00:30:08.576
Mirage, what have you done?

00:30:09.877 --> 00:30:11.812
You brought a human here?

00:30:11.945 --> 00:30:14.348
Optimus!
Hey! Looking good, man!

00:30:14.481 --> 00:30:16.016
Wait a second.
Are those new rims?

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.118
You were told
to stay hidden.

00:30:18.252 --> 00:30:20.354
Right, right.
Crazy coincidence.

00:30:20.487 --> 00:30:22.624
When you called,
all Optimus-like...

00:30:22.757 --> 00:30:24.592
"Autobots, roll out!"...

00:30:24.726 --> 00:30:26.493
...this guy
was already in the car.

00:30:26.628 --> 00:30:28.862
But he's cool,
so it's cool. Cool?

00:30:28.996 --> 00:30:30.532
Not cool.

00:30:33.934 --> 00:30:35.804
Who are you, human?

00:30:35.936 --> 00:30:37.838
I'm nobody.
I ain't even seen nothing.

00:30:37.971 --> 00:30:39.741
I'm not even seeing
anything right now.

00:30:39.873 --> 00:30:41.576
Arcee.

00:30:45.079 --> 00:30:47.114
Private Noah Diaz,
US Army.

00:30:47.247 --> 00:30:50.117
Multiple commendations.
A wizard with electronics.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.985
Huh. He's a soldier.

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:54.421
He does not look
like a soldier.

00:30:54.556 --> 00:30:58.693
I mean, you looking
pretty rough yourself.

00:30:58.827 --> 00:31:00.294
Sorry, sir.

00:31:00.427 --> 00:31:03.497
I will deal
with your mistake later.

00:31:05.899 --> 00:31:10.304
Okay, the energy surge
we felt was in the 4,000
yottahertz range,

00:31:10.437 --> 00:31:12.272
which is undetectable
to humans.

00:31:12.406 --> 00:31:15.476
I've reconstructed the source
from the energy echoes.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:19.146
I cannot believe it.
It exists and it is here.

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:21.148
What the hell am I looking at?

00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:22.650
The Transwarp Key.

00:31:22.784 --> 00:31:25.687
It was thought to be lost
thousands of years ago.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:30.124
It was once used
to open space-time portals

00:31:30.257 --> 00:31:33.728
to Energon-rich planets
throughout the universe.

00:31:33.862 --> 00:31:36.196
You mean Energon-rich
planets like...

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.464
Cybertron.

00:31:37.599 --> 00:31:40.434
After seven long years
stranded on Earth,

00:31:40.568 --> 00:31:42.704
we've finally found
a way home.

00:31:42.837 --> 00:31:44.438
Wait till I catch you, Reek.

00:31:44.572 --> 00:31:47.842
Okay, so where
is this t-tran, t-trun...

00:31:47.975 --> 00:31:49.176
Transwarp Key?
Thank you.

00:31:49.309 --> 00:31:51.044
It's in the new museum
on Ellis Island.

00:31:51.178 --> 00:31:54.181
Let's blow it up
and get the hell out of Dodge!

00:31:54.314 --> 00:31:57.317
No, we can't just go in
blasting and steal it, Bee.

00:31:57.451 --> 00:31:59.086
The humans
will hunt us down.

00:31:59.219 --> 00:32:01.756
What we need
is a quiet way in.

00:32:07.227 --> 00:32:08.495
Ooh, how about him?

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.698
- No.
- What? Come on, man.

00:32:10.832 --> 00:32:13.367
He could slip in right through
one of them little doors,

00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:16.069
grab the key,
leave a nice IOU
and peace out.

00:32:16.203 --> 00:32:18.773
He's perfect.
What?

00:32:18.907 --> 00:32:21.141
No, it is a bad idea.

00:32:21.275 --> 00:32:23.243
I agree with Big Man.

00:32:23.377 --> 00:32:26.548
So, it's been real, y'all.
But...

00:32:26.681 --> 00:32:28.315
Uh, time-out.
Mirage.

00:32:28.449 --> 00:32:31.151
I know. I know. Just relax.
Let me just talk to my guy
real quick.

00:32:31.285 --> 00:32:34.988
Yo, don't leave me
with these tight-asses, bro.
We make a great team.

00:32:35.122 --> 00:32:36.758
This is a waste of time.

00:32:36.891 --> 00:32:39.694
Look, I'm not
breaking into a museum
for some space robots.

00:32:39.828 --> 00:32:41.995
But what about for friendship?

00:32:42.864 --> 00:32:45.065
Uh, uh... Or, or, or

00:32:45.199 --> 00:32:47.401
what about for cash?

00:32:47.535 --> 00:32:51.371
Uh-huh.
You help us get this key,
so we can get off this rock--

00:32:51.506 --> 00:32:53.842
No offense.
Love the neighborhood and all.

00:32:53.974 --> 00:32:56.143
And then I let you sell me.

00:32:56.276 --> 00:32:58.546
Lambo?

00:32:59.514 --> 00:33:00.414
Ferrari?

00:33:01.114 --> 00:33:02.349
Indy?

00:33:03.518 --> 00:33:06.286
Look, you get paid
and then I'll split.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.388
So all I gotta do
is walk in and out?

00:33:08.523 --> 00:33:10.925
All you gotta do.
We'll take care of the rest.

00:33:11.058 --> 00:33:13.561
Cross my spark
and hope to die.

00:33:13.695 --> 00:33:16.363
Wow! That was corny
when I said it out loud.

00:33:17.899 --> 00:33:21.101
What about the big man?
Optimal, or whatever.

00:33:21.235 --> 00:33:23.505
You let me worry about him.

00:33:23.638 --> 00:33:24.672
Cool?

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.476
Ah! Got him!
He's in, baby! Whoo!

00:33:55.737 --> 00:33:58.038
Y'all are robots
that transform into cars,

00:33:58.171 --> 00:33:59.974
even though
you're from way out in space.

00:34:00.107 --> 00:34:02.777
But now there's this key
that opens a portal
back to your home?

00:34:02.911 --> 00:34:06.113
Oh, and you know this
because there's a beacon light
in the sky

00:34:06.246 --> 00:34:07.849
that I can't see
because I'm human.

00:34:07.982 --> 00:34:10.518
You say that like it's weird.
It's super weird.

00:34:10.652 --> 00:34:13.220
You know what's weird?
Marky Mark is leaving
the Funky Bunch!

00:34:13.353 --> 00:34:17.090
I heard he's just gonna pursue
acting now. That's crazy!
What?

00:34:17.224 --> 00:34:19.027
- How does that...
- What a world.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:20.327
Whatever, man.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.095
I'm just trying
to collect this money

00:34:22.229 --> 00:34:24.899
and get your
angry-ass boss off of Earth
before he blows a gasket.

00:34:25.033 --> 00:34:26.701
Don't take it personal.

00:34:26.834 --> 00:34:28.368
He just misses home.

00:34:28.503 --> 00:34:31.773
And I think he blames himself
for us getting stuck here.

00:34:31.906 --> 00:34:33.942
Earth was supposed
to be a pit stop, you know,

00:34:34.074 --> 00:34:37.845
a place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

00:34:37.979 --> 00:34:40.515
Prime feels like it's his fault
we've been stranded here,

00:34:40.648 --> 00:34:42.717
like he has to fix it
all on his own.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.820
All right, team, heads up.
There's security up ahead.

00:34:45.954 --> 00:34:47.087
Nice!

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.488
This is gonna be fun, man.

00:34:48.623 --> 00:34:50.625
No, no, no. No, bro.
You need to switch it up.

00:34:50.758 --> 00:34:54.062
You need to turn
into a helicopter
or a speedboat or something.

00:34:54.194 --> 00:34:56.531
I got something
way better than that.

00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:11.378
Good call.

00:35:14.048 --> 00:35:15.850
I do not like this plan.

00:35:15.984 --> 00:35:19.119
Yeah, Mirage isn't
really known for being quiet.

00:35:19.252 --> 00:35:21.154
At least Mirage is one of us.

00:35:21.288 --> 00:35:23.725
We should not be relying
on a human.

00:35:23.858 --> 00:35:24.993
They are my friends.

00:35:25.125 --> 00:35:27.194
I know one
was good to you, Bee,

00:35:27.327 --> 00:35:29.129
but this is not our world.

00:35:29.262 --> 00:35:32.100
The humans will always
protect what is theirs.

00:35:32.232 --> 00:35:35.069
We can only trust
our own kind.

00:35:35.202 --> 00:35:37.337
You can't handle
the truth!

00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:41.075
I do not want you going
to that drive-in theater
anymore.

00:36:26.453 --> 00:36:29.023
Nightbird,
search the island.

00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:34.261
Finally, the hunt
draws to a close.

00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:02.322
Hello?

00:37:19.073 --> 00:37:20.641
Fudge.

00:37:20.775 --> 00:37:21.809
Oh.

00:37:22.342 --> 00:37:23.611
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

00:37:27.648 --> 00:37:28.850
Hey, are you okay?
Back up!

00:37:28.983 --> 00:37:31.085
Yo, are you okay?
Back up! Back up! Back up!

00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:32.854
I didn't think anyone
was in here.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.125
That's it.

00:37:41.229 --> 00:37:43.064
Who are you? Hmm?

00:37:43.197 --> 00:37:44.632
I'm, uh...

00:37:45.233 --> 00:37:46.466
the janitor.

00:37:48.002 --> 00:37:49.804
Security!

00:37:49.937 --> 00:37:52.707
No, no, no!
You don't have to do that!
It's not what it looks like.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.777
It looks like you're trying
to steal museum property.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.879
Okay, it's a little
what it looks like.

00:37:59.247 --> 00:38:00.882
Oh, shit.

00:38:01.015 --> 00:38:04.185
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, yo, yo! It doesn't
belong to you anyway.

00:38:04.317 --> 00:38:07.255
- No, no, no!
- Just stop! Just...

00:38:07.387 --> 00:38:10.423
Hey, hey! Relax, relax,
and let me explain.

00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:13.094
It belongs to...

00:38:15.328 --> 00:38:16.764
...to these...

00:38:18.566 --> 00:38:23.436
these giant robots
from space.

00:38:23.971 --> 00:38:24.872
Really?

00:38:25.006 --> 00:38:26.507
Look, I'm gonna need that.

00:38:28.676 --> 00:38:30.077
Damn!

00:38:30.211 --> 00:38:31.779
- Damn!
- Hey!

00:38:31.913 --> 00:38:34.414
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on here?
Don't move.

00:38:34.549 --> 00:38:36.951
Man, it's about time
you showed up!

00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:45.492
The key.

00:39:08.282 --> 00:39:12.119
- You were telling the truth.
- Yeah.

00:39:12.253 --> 00:39:14.354
But those ones aren't with me.

00:39:18.125 --> 00:39:25.099
Rip the flesh from their bones
and bring me the key.

00:39:30.171 --> 00:39:31.404
It's yours.

00:39:42.016 --> 00:39:43.483
Guys, we got company!

00:39:50.958 --> 00:39:53.794
Autobots, protect the key!

00:39:56.063 --> 00:39:57.098
Catch!

00:40:07.474 --> 00:40:09.710
Not so fast!

00:40:13.981 --> 00:40:17.585
Oh, they're flying now?
Who the hell are these guys?

00:40:27.395 --> 00:40:29.563
Impossible!

00:40:29.697 --> 00:40:32.465
I enjoy
that look of confusion

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.837
when an inferior being
meets a higher power.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.649
What the hell
are those things?

00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:50.851
Are you okay?

00:40:53.888 --> 00:40:56.691
Hey! Stop following me!
I'm not following you!

00:40:56.824 --> 00:40:58.993
I'm just escaping
in the same direction.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.301
Um...

00:42:18.439 --> 00:42:19.740
Run!

00:42:20.341 --> 00:42:22.076
Go, go!

00:42:31.819 --> 00:42:34.021
Run!

00:42:34.155 --> 00:42:35.890
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:42:43.764 --> 00:42:44.932
Watch out!

00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:47.902
Thanks.

00:42:54.175 --> 00:42:56.977
Scourge,
I have eyes on the key.

00:42:58.379 --> 00:43:01.048
Prime, I don't think
we can hold these guys...

00:43:01.182 --> 00:43:02.817
Oh, no!

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:04.318
My God! Put me down!

00:43:07.021 --> 00:43:09.657
Whoa, that was so scary.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.659
Oh, cool.
You're still alive.

00:43:14.361 --> 00:43:15.596
Get the key!

00:43:16.831 --> 00:43:18.199
Noah, get out of here!

00:43:19.366 --> 00:43:21.836
Get off me! I hate spiders!

00:43:23.671 --> 00:43:27.041
Go, go, go!
Don't die, don't die,
don't die, don't die!

00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:32.746
Go! Get out of here!

00:43:38.853 --> 00:43:41.889
Uh-uh-uh.
Leaving so soon?

00:43:42.022 --> 00:43:44.559
Yo! Look out!

00:43:48.762 --> 00:43:50.297
The key!

00:43:55.402 --> 00:43:58.439
Enough of these games.
I'll get it myself.

00:43:58.573 --> 00:44:00.674
Not on my watch.

00:44:28.302 --> 00:44:31.405
Aw, don't be frightened, humans.

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.942
This'll all be over soon.

00:44:37.745 --> 00:44:39.713
And you call yourself a Prime.

00:44:39.847 --> 00:44:43.050
Primus would be ashamed.

00:44:56.297 --> 00:45:00.334
I'm tired of little things
getting in my way.

00:45:01.068 --> 00:45:01.769
Bee!

00:45:03.704 --> 00:45:05.472
O Captain! My Captain!

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.107
No!

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.394
Bee.

00:45:33.167 --> 00:45:36.170
Now to add a Prime
to my collection.

00:45:48.215 --> 00:45:49.917
Maximals.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.987
Good.
Maybe we'll get a real fight.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.490
No. We got what we came for.

00:46:01.395 --> 00:46:03.464
No.

00:46:04.331 --> 00:46:07.868
This cannot be.

00:46:24.818 --> 00:46:27.087
We must go now. Come with me.

00:46:51.412 --> 00:46:56.016
This is my fault.
It should've been me.

00:46:56.984 --> 00:46:59.420
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:46:59.554 --> 00:47:02.691
No offense, lady,
but who are you again?

00:47:02.856 --> 00:47:06.260
My name is Airazor.

00:47:06.393 --> 00:47:07.995
I am a Maximal.

00:47:08.128 --> 00:47:10.931
A warrior from both
your past and future.

00:47:11.065 --> 00:47:14.134
Oh, right. That--
That tracks. Yeah.

00:47:14.268 --> 00:47:18.172
We fled our home planet
on the eve of its destruction.

00:47:18.305 --> 00:47:21.710
We sought refuge
and hid here on Earth.

00:47:21.842 --> 00:47:24.211
Right.
So you're a Maximal.
Y'all are Autobots.

00:47:24.345 --> 00:47:26.347
What was those things
that attacked us earlier?

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.250
Terrorcons. Servants
of a dark, hungry god

00:47:30.384 --> 00:47:33.588
who feeds on entire worlds
to sustain himself.

00:47:33.722 --> 00:47:35.489
Unicron.

00:47:35.623 --> 00:47:39.259
So you're saying
this thing Unicron
eats planets to survive?

00:47:39.393 --> 00:47:43.565
Yes. And he imbues
his servants, like Scourge,

00:47:43.698 --> 00:47:48.969
with dark energy,
which makes him
all but invincible.

00:47:49.103 --> 00:47:52.072
He is entirely beholden
to Unicron.

00:47:52.206 --> 00:47:56.611
Through his power,
he possesses Scourge's soul.

00:47:56.745 --> 00:47:59.514
Awaken, my dark master.

00:48:17.565 --> 00:48:19.801
Rise.

00:48:19.933 --> 00:48:22.771
My hunger is killing me.

00:48:22.903 --> 00:48:24.304
What have you found?

00:48:24.438 --> 00:48:26.240
Salvation.

00:48:26.373 --> 00:48:31.478
The galaxy will once again
be yours to feast on,
my master.

00:48:32.547 --> 00:48:35.182
I should've gotten
the key myself.

00:48:35.315 --> 00:48:37.852
I should've known better
than to rely on humans.

00:48:37.985 --> 00:48:40.120
Yo, hold up.
What, you blaming me?

00:48:40.254 --> 00:48:44.091
After you conveniently
left out the part
about a planet-eating monster?

00:48:44.224 --> 00:48:46.427
Because of you,
Unicron will now use the key

00:48:46.561 --> 00:48:49.129
to consume every planet
in the universe!

00:48:49.263 --> 00:48:51.198
Including my home world.

00:48:51.331 --> 00:48:54.935
He doesn't have the key.
At least not all of it.

00:48:55.068 --> 00:48:58.606
You fool!

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.075
This is only half the key.
Please!

00:49:02.209 --> 00:49:06.413
The Maximals...
They must have split it.

00:49:06.548 --> 00:49:08.148
Excuses!

00:49:08.282 --> 00:49:11.118
Complete the key,
or else you will wish
you had died

00:49:11.251 --> 00:49:13.353
with the rest of your planet.

00:49:13.487 --> 00:49:17.224
We broke the key
into two pieces
for safekeeping,

00:49:17.357 --> 00:49:20.027
then splintered
and went into hiding.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:23.197
I do not know
where the other half is.

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:28.001
For all I know,
I am the last of our kind.

00:49:28.703 --> 00:49:30.070
It's in Peru.

00:49:30.204 --> 00:49:31.472
How you know that?

00:49:31.606 --> 00:49:33.508
It's the symbols
on the stone.

00:49:33.641 --> 00:49:36.343
They were only ever recorded
in one other place
in the world.

00:49:36.477 --> 00:49:39.079
The Inca Temple of the Sun
in Cusco.

00:49:39.213 --> 00:49:42.817
It's one of the oldest buildings
in the western hemisphere.
I'm-I'm...

00:49:42.951 --> 00:49:45.720
I'm guessing that
that can't be a coincidence.

00:49:45.854 --> 00:49:49.824
If you can track
those symbols to Peru,
so can the Terrorcons.

00:49:49.958 --> 00:49:51.492
We need to get there
before they do.

00:49:51.626 --> 00:49:56.731
And then kill Scourge
and take his piece
to complete the key.

00:49:56.865 --> 00:49:58.232
Yo. Hold up. Hold up.

00:49:58.365 --> 00:50:00.334
You want to find
this other key

00:50:00.467 --> 00:50:03.403
and deliver it to the guy
that just kicked your asses.

00:50:03.538 --> 00:50:05.640
The Transwarp Key
is our only way home.

00:50:05.773 --> 00:50:08.877
If this dude
gets ahold of that thing,
it's game over for Earth!

00:50:09.009 --> 00:50:11.613
Our families, everybody!

00:50:15.182 --> 00:50:16.116
I'm going.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:17.886
Out of the question.

00:50:18.018 --> 00:50:21.856
No offense,
but I'm not trusting
my home to a guy

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:23.591
who couldn't even protect his.

00:50:24.959 --> 00:50:27.695
This is my planet.
I'm going.

00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:29.363
What about you?

00:50:32.266 --> 00:50:35.035
Me?
What is your name?

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:36.804
Elena.

00:50:36.938 --> 00:50:38.305
Elena,

00:50:38.438 --> 00:50:40.775
will you lead us
to this temple?

00:50:43.711 --> 00:50:46.014
Chance to stop
the end of the world.

00:50:46.146 --> 00:50:47.849
Actually,

00:50:47.982 --> 00:50:50.484
you'll be saving two worlds.

00:50:57.859 --> 00:50:58.860
Yeah.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:11.539
Yo, is that you, Sonic?

00:51:14.074 --> 00:51:15.777
What are you doing up, Tails?

00:51:16.476 --> 00:51:18.278
I can't sleep.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:29.624
This too hot?

00:51:30.959 --> 00:51:32.392
You playing
that game too much.

00:51:32.527 --> 00:51:34.762
Give it a rest,
so your hand can take a break.

00:51:34.896 --> 00:51:36.731
I'm gonna beat it.

00:51:38.967 --> 00:51:40.167
My money's on you, bro.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.970
We don't quit.

00:51:42.102 --> 00:51:43.905
Come on, get some sleep,
all right?

00:51:51.813 --> 00:51:53.648
Yo, listen, um,

00:51:53.781 --> 00:51:56.116
I gotta--
I gotta head out for a while.

00:51:56.249 --> 00:51:58.620
And I don't know
when I'm gonna be back.

00:51:59.152 --> 00:52:00.088
Why?

00:52:02.056 --> 00:52:05.292
Oh, shit.

00:52:10.163 --> 00:52:11.532
- What the...
- No, no, no!

00:52:11.666 --> 00:52:13.735
No! Stop, please!
Turn off! Turn off!

00:52:13.868 --> 00:52:16.303
Yo, won't you--
I told you to sit tight.

00:52:16.436 --> 00:52:18.138
Stop it.
I can't turn it off.
I'm sorry.

00:52:18.271 --> 00:52:19.272
Is that a robot?

00:52:19.406 --> 00:52:21.009
No, no, no.
Go-- Go back to bed.

00:52:21.141 --> 00:52:24.277
Yo, shut it off!
I think your bad hot-wiring
messed up my lights.

00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:25.913
I got the bat.
Yo, chill. Give me that.

00:52:26.047 --> 00:52:28.850
- Did he say "bat"?
- You're gonna wake up Ma!

00:52:34.221 --> 00:52:36.456
I know you're a robot.

00:52:37.725 --> 00:52:38.860
Kris?

00:52:46.134 --> 00:52:48.670
Yo! You scratched my paint!

00:52:49.604 --> 00:52:51.238
What are you doing?

00:52:51.371 --> 00:52:53.074
Man, they didn't
treat E.T. like this.

00:52:53.206 --> 00:52:54.575
You know this thing?
Yeah.

00:52:54.709 --> 00:52:57.244
We're just work friends.

00:52:57.377 --> 00:53:00.247
"Work friends"?
You've been inside me.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:04.118
Look, that thing I told you
I have to go do?

00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:05.520
It's for him and his crew.

00:53:05.653 --> 00:53:07.287
We're trying to stop
the end of the world.

00:53:07.421 --> 00:53:08.488
The world's ending?

00:53:08.623 --> 00:53:10.925
No!
Maybe. Sixty-forty.

00:53:11.059 --> 00:53:13.528
You know I'm not gonna
let that happen.

00:53:13.661 --> 00:53:15.596
But that's why
I have to leave.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.601
I'll go get my things.

00:53:21.401 --> 00:53:22.970
Tough kid.

00:53:23.104 --> 00:53:25.439
What? No. Whoa, whoa.
Hold up. Hold up.
You're not coming.

00:53:25.573 --> 00:53:30.310
Why? You need someone
to watch your back.
It's too dangerous, Kris.

00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:34.347
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mom.

00:53:36.416 --> 00:53:38.418
'Cause you might not
come back.

00:53:52.066 --> 00:53:53.668
Hey, robot.

00:53:54.468 --> 00:53:57.071
Me? 'Sup?

00:53:57.205 --> 00:54:00.875
Watch out for my brother.
Okay?

00:54:01.008 --> 00:54:02.910
You got it, little man.

00:54:03.044 --> 00:54:04.679
Nah, I'm serious.

00:54:04.812 --> 00:54:07.582
If he gets hurt,
I'm coming after you.

00:54:09.183 --> 00:54:12.687
Don't worry.
I got Noah's back. I promise.

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.021
Mm-hmm.

00:54:16.791 --> 00:54:17.925
Home team?

00:54:20.895 --> 00:54:21.929
Home team.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.835
Kid's got heart.

00:54:27.969 --> 00:54:29.937
Cojones muy grande.

00:54:40.782 --> 00:54:43.751
Wu-Tang is
in the building, baby!

00:54:43.885 --> 00:54:45.920
Way to be incognito.

00:54:46.053 --> 00:54:48.790
Aw, come on, Prime.
Smile a little bit.

00:54:48.923 --> 00:54:50.958
It won't hurt.
Let me see that underbite.

00:54:51.092 --> 00:54:54.262
All right.
So what kind of jet
we taking to Peru?

00:54:54.394 --> 00:54:55.930
Or is it a plane?
Either one's fine.

00:54:56.063 --> 00:54:58.900
I just need first class, okay?
'Cause I got long-ass legs.

00:54:59.033 --> 00:55:00.668
Uh, well, he is a plane.

00:55:00.802 --> 00:55:02.469
No. No, no. Don't...

00:55:02.603 --> 00:55:04.337
Don't tell me
we're flying on...

00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:05.873
Oh, no.

00:55:24.158 --> 00:55:28.663
My lads! I am Stratosphere,
lord of the skies!

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:37.772
Yeah,
I'm walking to Peru.

00:55:46.814 --> 00:55:47.849
Ooh.

00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:50.117
Oh, my gosh.

00:55:59.126 --> 00:56:00.460
Sorry.

00:56:00.595 --> 00:56:03.931
I sing when I get nervous.
It usually calms me down.

00:56:04.065 --> 00:56:05.299
First time flying?

00:56:05.432 --> 00:56:07.902
Man, this is my first time
leaving New York.

00:56:09.303 --> 00:56:11.873
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.175
So the Bronx, huh?

00:56:14.308 --> 00:56:16.277
Brooklyn, all right?

00:56:16.409 --> 00:56:18.145
East New York all day.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.081
I'm from Bushwick.

00:56:20.214 --> 00:56:22.449
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:24.952
Um, me and my dad,
we used to go to this--

00:56:25.086 --> 00:56:27.521
this pizza spot down
on Knickerbocker and Greene.

00:56:27.655 --> 00:56:30.423
Tony's Pizza? Wow.

00:56:34.795 --> 00:56:37.198
So, uh, tell me about him,
your pops.

00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:38.465
What-- What was he like?

00:56:38.599 --> 00:56:42.402
He was a--
He was a cabbie for 40 years.

00:56:42.536 --> 00:56:45.206
Smartest guy you ever met.

00:56:45.339 --> 00:56:47.474
He could talk to you
about anything.

00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:50.211
History, science, cricket.

00:56:50.344 --> 00:56:52.113
Cricket?

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.349
And he ain't never
even go to college either.

00:56:55.482 --> 00:56:57.385
He used to always say,

00:56:57.518 --> 00:57:00.922
"If you keep your eyes
and your ears open,

00:57:01.055 --> 00:57:03.691
life will show you
everything you need to know."

00:57:05.893 --> 00:57:08.329
So that's why you said yes
to all of this.

00:57:09.163 --> 00:57:11.632
I figured if
he is somewhere watching,

00:57:11.766 --> 00:57:15.670
then seeing his daughter
do something crazy like this

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:18.471
would definitely
make him proud.

00:57:28.149 --> 00:57:30.885
You really think
this key thing's in Peru?

00:57:31.018 --> 00:57:32.219
I-- I think so.

00:57:32.353 --> 00:57:33.988
The evidence lines up.

00:57:35.756 --> 00:57:38.759
Well, if it is,
and we get our hands on it,

00:57:38.893 --> 00:57:40.328
then we gotta destroy it.

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.229
What?

00:57:42.363 --> 00:57:45.533
They can't unite the key
without both pieces.

00:57:45.666 --> 00:57:49.503
No key, no Unicron,
no Earth getting eaten.

00:57:52.873 --> 00:57:55.042
Yeah, but then
they can't get home.

00:57:56.444 --> 00:57:58.079
We gotta think about us.

00:58:01.949 --> 00:58:03.985
Look, all you gotta do
is find it.

00:58:04.118 --> 00:58:06.187
And I'll take care
of the rest.

00:58:10.291 --> 00:58:14.395
Do you think
an Energon infusion
could bring him back?

00:58:14.528 --> 00:58:15.763
Perhaps.

00:58:16.597 --> 00:58:19.233
If we could get him
back to Cybertron.

00:58:20.901 --> 00:58:24.271
I never should have taken us
so far from home.

00:59:06.213 --> 00:59:08.682
Wow! Wheeljack needs to fix
that power steering.

00:59:11.685 --> 00:59:12.920
Sorry I'm late.

00:59:13.054 --> 00:59:14.822
I was taking in
a harmonious moment

00:59:14.955 --> 00:59:18.659
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

00:59:18.793 --> 00:59:20.261
Such tranquility.

00:59:20.394 --> 00:59:23.898
Yo-ho-ho.
Oye, papo, where you from?
Cybertron.

00:59:24.031 --> 00:59:26.367
So where'd you
get that accent?
Accent? What accent?

00:59:26.501 --> 00:59:28.669
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just saying it's cool.

00:59:28.803 --> 00:59:31.272
I was about to be like,
"¿Yo, mira, papi,
de dónde eres?"

00:59:31.405 --> 00:59:35.209
Pero I didn't want to assume
that you speak Spanish too,

00:59:35.342 --> 00:59:36.577
because then... Right?

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:39.246
Mmm.
A little racist, hermano.

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.516
I'm not trying to be,
you know... Yo.

00:59:41.649 --> 00:59:44.718
But anyway... The mission.
Follow me.

00:59:44.852 --> 00:59:47.088
But he's a robot,
like, so,

00:59:47.788 --> 00:59:49.590
how's that racist?

00:59:52.993 --> 00:59:54.862
Okay, you guys,
check this out.

00:59:54.995 --> 00:59:58.199
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

00:59:58.332 --> 00:59:59.300
Take a look.

01:00:01.669 --> 01:00:05.239
That's Santo Domingo.
The Spanish built it on top
of an old Inca temple.

01:00:05.372 --> 01:00:09.210
Correcto. I picked up
some residual energy readings
around the courtyard,

01:00:09.343 --> 01:00:11.912
so I'm guessing
the key's somewhere close by.

01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:14.348
But we may have some trouble
getting there.

01:00:14.482 --> 01:00:15.816
Inti Raymi.

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:18.419
It's a festival that
shuts down the whole city.

01:00:18.553 --> 01:00:20.988
- Guess it's a night mission then.
-  No.

01:00:21.122 --> 01:00:23.257
Scourge could already be here.

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:26.994
We must retrieve
the other half before he does.

01:00:28.963 --> 01:00:31.198
Me and Elena will do it.
Hmm?

01:00:31.332 --> 01:00:33.367
Y'all would never
make it two blocks.

01:00:33.502 --> 01:00:36.070
There's human security
all around the church.
You'll never get through.

01:00:36.203 --> 01:00:39.006
Then we'll have to take
a play out of your book.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.208
We'll hide in plain sight.

01:00:41.342 --> 01:00:43.677
We'll blend in
with the parade.

01:00:43.811 --> 01:00:46.647
It is not a bad idea.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.551
We will keep an eye out
for the Terrorcons.

01:00:49.683 --> 01:00:53.320
On first sign of trouble,
we are going in.

01:00:53.454 --> 01:00:54.855
Yo, Noah, think fast.

01:01:01.028 --> 01:01:03.430
And if you need help,
just holler.

01:01:18.846 --> 01:01:21.182
I am in position.

01:01:21.315 --> 01:01:23.150
All right, coast is clear.

01:01:23.284 --> 01:01:26.187
Noah, Elena, it's go time.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.190
Blend in. Act natural.

01:02:01.623 --> 01:02:04.659
Autobots must be using
their new pets

01:02:04.825 --> 01:02:06.760
to reach the temple.

01:02:06.894 --> 01:02:08.996
Lovely.

01:02:09.129 --> 01:02:12.032
They're doing our work
for us.

01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:14.301
Go fetch.

01:02:18.906 --> 01:02:21.141
The key's gotta be
in here somewhere.

01:02:21.742 --> 01:02:22.977
Yeah.

01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:39.126
That stonework is 17th century.

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:42.530
What we're looking for
is something

01:02:43.397 --> 01:02:46.267
much, much older.

01:02:54.375 --> 01:02:57.278
What is it?
It's the same insignia
on Airazor.

01:02:58.045 --> 01:02:59.780
But it's not lined up right.

01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:04.118
Wait, you see that?

01:03:04.251 --> 01:03:09.356
I think there's something
under here.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.862
There's another one.

01:03:18.966 --> 01:03:20.535
There is.

01:03:29.644 --> 01:03:30.911
Now what?

01:03:32.046 --> 01:03:34.481
I thought it would've--

01:03:47.861 --> 01:03:50.297
That's some
Indiana Jones-type shit.

01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:53.400
You sure about this?

01:03:53.934 --> 01:03:55.169
No.

01:04:03.844 --> 01:04:05.913
Any sign of Scourge?

01:04:06.046 --> 01:04:07.381
Nope, all clear here.

01:04:07.515 --> 01:04:08.817
Uh, yeah.

01:04:08.949 --> 01:04:10.652
It's just groupies
over here.

01:04:10.785 --> 01:04:12.953
Stay on task, Mirage.

01:04:13.087 --> 01:04:16.190
Prime, you gotta learn
how to relax, my man.

01:04:23.665 --> 01:04:24.898
Ah.

01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:42.916
You know, we must be
the first people to walk here
in half a millennium.

01:04:44.351 --> 01:04:46.821
Yo, Sonic. You dead yet?

01:04:48.656 --> 01:04:49.758
No.

01:04:50.491 --> 01:04:52.660
Wait, did you just
call me Sonic?

01:04:52.794 --> 01:04:54.328
I think that's a temple.

01:05:00.869 --> 01:05:02.604
What are we looking for?

01:05:02.737 --> 01:05:04.873
You see the symbols
on that temple?

01:05:05.005 --> 01:05:06.775
They match the ones
in the courtyard.

01:05:06.907 --> 01:05:08.475
I think it's up there.

01:05:20.087 --> 01:05:22.456
I think we found
what we came here for.

01:05:24.992 --> 01:05:26.561
I always wondered
what it would feel like

01:05:26.694 --> 01:05:29.664
to be there when artifacts
were actually found.

01:05:32.299 --> 01:05:35.169
All right. Now come on, push.

01:05:42.844 --> 01:05:44.846
Are you even pushing?

01:05:44.978 --> 01:05:46.980
Yeah, I'm pushing.

01:05:58.292 --> 01:06:00.528
Wait, what?
Just-- Just let me think.

01:06:00.662 --> 01:06:02.329
Oh, no, no. Where is it?

01:06:02.463 --> 01:06:07.000
Sometimes there's, like, a--
like a false bottom
or something.

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:11.438
Look.

01:06:11.573 --> 01:06:14.374
I think I found something.
You see these symbols?

01:06:14.509 --> 01:06:17.846
I've seen markings like this--
the Airazor statue
at my museum.

01:06:17.978 --> 01:06:19.948
They're new.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.249
They're not
on the Transwarp Key.

01:06:22.382 --> 01:06:24.284
There's two of them.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.394
Mirage?

01:06:38.432 --> 01:06:41.435
Let's keep moving.
Just give me a second.

01:06:45.673 --> 01:06:46.941
Run!

01:06:54.649 --> 01:06:56.149
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:06:56.283 --> 01:06:58.085
Mirage! We got trouble!

01:06:58.218 --> 01:07:01.255
One of those things
is down here!
Where are you guys?

01:07:01.388 --> 01:07:03.490
Hang tight!
I'm on the way.

01:07:06.059 --> 01:07:07.394
The Autobots are moving.

01:07:07.529 --> 01:07:10.197
They must have found the key.

01:07:21.441 --> 01:07:22.744
Come on!

01:07:24.177 --> 01:07:25.547
Airazor, where are the humans?

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.683
They're underground,
heading towards the jungle.

01:07:45.867 --> 01:07:48.368
Aw, man,
they're tailing us!

01:07:57.845 --> 01:07:59.948
Do something!
What do you want me to do?

01:08:07.689 --> 01:08:09.657
You had a gun
this whole time?

01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:29.744
Prime, what the hell
are you doing?

01:08:29.877 --> 01:08:32.814
I'm going to take back
Scourge's key

01:08:32.947 --> 01:08:36.084
and then take off his head.

01:08:47.595 --> 01:08:50.430
Guys!
I could use a little help!

01:08:50.565 --> 01:08:52.834
Did someone call
for backup?

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:02.710
- Brake, brake, brake!
- What?

01:09:02.844 --> 01:09:04.946
Brake!

01:09:12.386 --> 01:09:15.322
Yay!

01:09:16.256 --> 01:09:18.492
This is for Bee!

01:09:30.237 --> 01:09:31.873
Come here.

01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:33.440
Hold on!

01:09:53.326 --> 01:09:55.797
I love your fire, Prime.

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:59.667
But you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:03.771
I can think of no better place
to bury you.

01:10:31.532 --> 01:10:34.001
I will end you, Scourge.

01:10:35.903 --> 01:10:39.306
That is a promise.

01:10:39.439 --> 01:10:41.008
They're getting away.

01:10:41.142 --> 01:10:42.977
Not this time.

01:10:49.817 --> 01:10:52.352
I hear water.

01:10:56.157 --> 01:10:57.692
Where are we?

01:11:03.898 --> 01:11:04.632
What was that?

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.782
Who are you?

01:11:20.915 --> 01:11:22.683
And why are you hunting
for the key?

01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:25.052
Yo, Donkey Kong!
Stay away from my friends!

01:11:25.186 --> 01:11:28.156
Uh, Mirage?
Don't worry.
Your boy's got this.

01:11:30.758 --> 01:11:33.594
Stranger danger!
Stranger danger!

01:11:34.228 --> 01:11:36.030
Hey, hey, hey!

01:11:36.164 --> 01:11:37.364
Not so fa--

01:11:41.836 --> 01:11:42.603
Ay, ay, ay.

01:11:42.737 --> 01:11:45.606
Hey! Over here,
kitty, kitty.

01:11:46.507 --> 01:11:49.309
Stand down!

01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:54.582
I won't ask a second time.

01:11:59.086 --> 01:12:01.421
No! All of you, stop!

01:12:04.258 --> 01:12:06.326
Airazor.
Primal.

01:12:06.459 --> 01:12:09.396
I thought you were lost.
All of you.

01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:12.600
The others... Are they...

01:12:12.733 --> 01:12:15.603
I am all that is left.

01:12:18.806 --> 01:12:22.210
Prime, these are
my fellow Maximals.

01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:24.545
Rhinox.

01:12:24.679 --> 01:12:26.214
Cheetor.

01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:27.849
Sorry about scaring you,
brother.

01:12:27.982 --> 01:12:29.884
- Scared?
- Please.

01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:31.519
I'm not scared.

01:12:31.652 --> 01:12:32.987
That's just engine oil.

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.892
And our leader,
Optimus Primal.

01:12:38.593 --> 01:12:40.493
Optimus Primal?

01:12:40.628 --> 01:12:44.966
Named after you,
the legendary warrior
of Cybertron.

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:46.433
It's an honor.

01:12:47.602 --> 01:12:50.605
Airazor,
I'm happy to see you,
old friend.

01:12:50.738 --> 01:12:53.741
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:56.376
I fear you bring dark tidings.

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:58.613
Scourge has come to Earth.

01:12:58.746 --> 01:13:00.480
He's found us.

01:13:00.615 --> 01:13:02.884
And he has half of the key.

01:13:03.017 --> 01:13:05.720
We must find
the second piece
before he does.

01:13:05.853 --> 01:13:07.655
But it wasn't
in the cave.

01:13:07.788 --> 01:13:10.892
It was.
But we moved it long ago
to keep it safe.

01:13:11.025 --> 01:13:13.460
Where is it now?

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:17.965
Come with me.

01:13:26.007 --> 01:13:27.842
That doesn't look so good.

01:13:27.975 --> 01:13:31.612
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

01:13:32.246 --> 01:13:34.481
But I'll be all right.

01:13:47.094 --> 01:13:48.963
Hey, back there
you called me Sonic.

01:13:49.096 --> 01:13:51.098
Yeah. Your little bro's
got this thing

01:13:51.232 --> 01:13:53.935
about using real names
over the airwaves, so...

01:13:54.068 --> 01:13:55.770
Wait, you been talking
to Kris?
Uh-huh.

01:13:55.903 --> 01:13:59.340
He gave me this
to keep tabs on you,

01:13:59.472 --> 01:14:00.942
make sure I'm keeping
my promise.

01:14:01.075 --> 01:14:02.410
Oh, here.

01:14:02.543 --> 01:14:04.512
Next time,
include warning labels.

01:14:04.645 --> 01:14:07.447
Nah, go ahead, keep it.

01:14:07.581 --> 01:14:09.350
I guess it does
look better on me.

01:14:09.482 --> 01:14:12.253
Just don't ask
what part of my body
it came from.

01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:17.091
So, who are you?

01:14:17.224 --> 01:14:19.193
We Maximals
are an advanced race

01:14:19.327 --> 01:14:23.597
dedicated to
the expansion of life
throughout the universe.

01:14:23.731 --> 01:14:26.867
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

01:14:27.001 --> 01:14:30.671
The Nazca Lines,
the Temple at Tikal--

01:14:30.805 --> 01:14:32.440
That was you guys,
right?

01:14:32.573 --> 01:14:33.741
Not us.

01:14:33.874 --> 01:14:36.177
We cannot claim credit
for human ingenuity.

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:39.780
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

01:14:39.914 --> 01:14:42.216
When Unicron destroyed
our world,

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:46.287
we took an oath dedicated
to the preservation of life,

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.322
no matter the cost.

01:14:48.456 --> 01:14:50.858
And Earth
has been a safe refuge.

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:32.066
This is Amaru.

01:15:32.199 --> 01:15:35.169
He and his family
are the last descendants
of a tribe

01:15:35.302 --> 01:15:38.072
that has watched over us
for hundreds of years.

01:15:38.205 --> 01:15:43.110
When we arrived,
they shared their world
with us.

01:15:43.244 --> 01:15:45.679
And together
we protected its people

01:15:45.813 --> 01:15:48.849
and our secret.

01:15:55.356 --> 01:15:57.258
You allied with humans.

01:15:58.192 --> 01:15:59.927
We did.

01:16:00.928 --> 01:16:03.230
If you give us this key,

01:16:03.364 --> 01:16:07.368
tomorrow I will light the beacon
and bring Scourge to us.

01:16:07.502 --> 01:16:11.972
The Maximals have
already sacrificed one home
to protect the universe.

01:16:12.106 --> 01:16:14.509
I won't risk losing another.

01:16:14.642 --> 01:16:17.578
As a leader,
I know you understand.

01:16:42.269 --> 01:16:45.906
He is not the Optimus Prime
I imagined.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.110
Well, he has lost so much.

01:16:49.243 --> 01:16:50.911
Many more will perish

01:16:51.045 --> 01:16:54.048
if the key falls
into the wrong hands.

01:16:54.181 --> 01:16:57.885
If you had another chance
to save our home,

01:16:58.018 --> 01:17:00.054
would you act any differently?

01:17:04.024 --> 01:17:07.261
Optimus, come.
I want to show you something.

01:17:12.032 --> 01:17:14.635
Your friend
will find peace here.

01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:18.672
This is raw Energon.

01:17:18.806 --> 01:17:20.708
The valley is rich with it.

01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:23.110
Could this revive Bee?

01:17:23.244 --> 01:17:26.680
I'm sorry,
but in this state,
it is inert.

01:17:26.814 --> 01:17:29.216
It would take a great power
to ignite it.

01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:32.386
Greater than anything
we have here.

01:17:34.955 --> 01:17:38.125
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

01:17:38.259 --> 01:17:39.927
Yes, I am.

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:42.796
I've been amongst them
a long time now.

01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:46.233
There is more to them
than meets the eye.

01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:48.335
They are worth saving.

01:17:59.346 --> 01:18:00.381
Hmm.

01:18:23.037 --> 01:18:24.872
What if we didn't
destroy it?

01:18:26.774 --> 01:18:32.112
Maybe there's another way
to-- to save both our homes.

01:18:32.246 --> 01:18:35.716
Elena, I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

01:18:37.318 --> 01:18:38.953
This is different.

01:18:41.155 --> 01:18:43.157
I can't fail at this.

01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:45.859
I can't let my family down.

01:18:45.993 --> 01:18:49.129
You're just like him.
You know that?

01:18:49.263 --> 01:18:50.431
Who?

01:18:50.565 --> 01:18:51.932
Optimus.

01:18:53.334 --> 01:18:54.669
I'm serious.

01:18:54.802 --> 01:18:58.005
He feels it too.
Feels what?

01:18:58.138 --> 01:19:00.140
Like a beast of burden

01:19:00.274 --> 01:19:04.411
just trying to carry
the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:09.283
You think he's some--
some general barking orders,

01:19:09.416 --> 01:19:11.352
but when I look at him,

01:19:11.485 --> 01:19:14.822
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

01:20:12.146 --> 01:20:13.814
Are you okay?

01:20:20.287 --> 01:20:21.288
Airazor?

01:20:21.422 --> 01:20:24.892
I can feel Scourge!

01:20:25.025 --> 01:20:27.562
- He's...
- ...in my mind.

01:20:37.004 --> 01:20:39.907
Run, Elena!

01:20:42.476 --> 01:20:43.678
No!

01:20:47.247 --> 01:20:50.351
Airazor.

01:20:50.484 --> 01:20:51.720
They found us.

01:20:51.852 --> 01:20:55.089
Everyone,
defensive positions!

01:20:55.222 --> 01:20:57.592
Noah, guard the key.

01:20:57.726 --> 01:21:01.261
Take Elena
and find someplace safe
to hide.

01:21:02.697 --> 01:21:04.465
We must protect
the humans.

01:21:07.267 --> 01:21:08.837
Miss me?

01:21:08.969 --> 01:21:12.072
Noah, Elena,
get out of here!

01:21:27.888 --> 01:21:29.624
We have to destroy it.

01:21:31.826 --> 01:21:32.861
Noah!

01:21:32.993 --> 01:21:34.629
No!

01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:37.297
Don't.

01:21:39.466 --> 01:21:43.203
I know you want
to protect your people,

01:21:43.337 --> 01:21:46.039
but if you destroy that key,

01:21:46.173 --> 01:21:49.009
our home will be lost forever.

01:21:49.143 --> 01:21:51.546
We do not have to choose.

01:21:58.152 --> 01:22:00.220
Please, Noah.

01:22:18.506 --> 01:22:20.274
Elena!

01:22:24.546 --> 01:22:25.580
Go!

01:22:47.602 --> 01:22:49.136
Elena!

01:22:53.808 --> 01:22:58.078
Wait, wait.
Didn't I kill you already?

01:22:58.913 --> 01:23:00.380
No!

01:23:00.515 --> 01:23:03.150
I'm the Maximal that's going
to rip out your spark.

01:23:03.283 --> 01:23:06.521
We'll see about that.

01:23:06.654 --> 01:23:07.622
Kill them!

01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:15.563
Airazor, no!

01:23:15.697 --> 01:23:18.700
I can't hold it back...

01:23:18.833 --> 01:23:20.635
...much longer.

01:23:20.768 --> 01:23:23.237
Fight it, Airazor.

01:23:24.037 --> 01:23:26.941
Remember our oath, Primal.

01:23:27.074 --> 01:23:29.511
No matter the cost.

01:23:29.644 --> 01:23:33.515
I can't hold it back!
Airazor, no!

01:23:45.092 --> 01:23:46.528
Primal!

01:23:53.868 --> 01:23:56.938
It's okay.

01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:58.640
Do it.

01:24:22.530 --> 01:24:24.231
Primal.

01:24:25.399 --> 01:24:27.467
No matter the cost.

01:24:36.343 --> 01:24:38.278
Elena!
Elena, look at me.

01:24:39.346 --> 01:24:40.748
Are you okay?

01:24:43.383 --> 01:24:45.218
Scourge has the key.

01:25:29.597 --> 01:25:34.468
Awaken, almighty Unicron.
Your time has come.

01:26:37.364 --> 01:26:40.200
I am sorry, Noah.

01:26:40.333 --> 01:26:42.369
You were looking out
for your own.

01:26:45.238 --> 01:26:46.974
I can't even be angry
at you for that.

01:26:47.108 --> 01:26:51.746
On my home world,
we believe that the battle
with darkness will continue

01:26:51.879 --> 01:26:53.981
till all are one.

01:26:55.415 --> 01:26:57.350
I lost sight of that.

01:26:57.484 --> 01:27:01.421
You fought for yours
as I fought for mine

01:27:01.556 --> 01:27:05.292
when we should
have been fighting
the darkness together.

01:27:08.663 --> 01:27:11.398
Well, I ain't done
fighting yet.

01:27:15.737 --> 01:27:17.905
All right, everybody,
squad up!

01:27:18.039 --> 01:27:19.439
Bring it in.

01:27:19.574 --> 01:27:21.274
There's got to be a way
to stop this dude.

01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:25.580
It's too late.
The Transwarp has already
been activated.

01:27:25.713 --> 01:27:28.381
It has more energy
than a supernova.

01:27:28.516 --> 01:27:31.318
Any interruption
will ignite it like a bomb.

01:27:32.587 --> 01:27:34.155
The only way
to stop this process

01:27:34.287 --> 01:27:37.658
is an access code
installed long ago
as a safeguard.

01:27:37.792 --> 01:27:39.259
Okay, what's the code then?

01:27:39.392 --> 01:27:41.863
The code was split
along with the key.

01:27:41.996 --> 01:27:46.234
Sadly, the second half
of that code died
with Airazor.

01:27:46.366 --> 01:27:47.668
No, wait, wait, wait.
I got it.

01:27:47.802 --> 01:27:49.436
The one hiding
her half of the key--

01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:51.072
that had markings in it

01:27:51.205 --> 01:27:53.641
just like the ones
I found in the cave
where you hid yours.

01:27:53.775 --> 01:27:56.878
Together, they must complete
the access code.

01:27:57.011 --> 01:27:57.945
Hmm.

01:27:58.079 --> 01:27:59.914
So we got a chance now, right?

01:28:00.047 --> 01:28:01.348
A slim chance.

01:28:01.481 --> 01:28:03.316
That is all we need

01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:06.286
if you will show us the way,
Primal.

01:28:08.923 --> 01:28:11.592
All right.
We need to move quickly.

01:28:11.726 --> 01:28:13.795
We have a small window
before the portal opens

01:28:13.928 --> 01:28:15.663
large enough
for Unicron to enter.

01:28:15.797 --> 01:28:18.900
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

01:28:19.033 --> 01:28:21.401
They are too small
for Maximals, but...

01:28:21.536 --> 01:28:23.070
But not for humans.

01:28:23.204 --> 01:28:26.874
If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

01:28:27.008 --> 01:28:29.476
they can use the code
to shut it down,

01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:32.013
remove the Transwarp Key...

01:28:32.146 --> 01:28:36.017
...and close the portal
before Unicron enters
our atmosphere.

01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:38.186
But Scourge
will be watching
our every move.

01:28:38.318 --> 01:28:40.788
He'll do anything to stop us
from getting the key.

01:28:40.922 --> 01:28:43.157
Then we bring
the fight to him.

01:28:43.291 --> 01:28:45.425
Autobots and Maximals

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.762
will charge the bridge
together

01:28:47.895 --> 01:28:50.463
and lure Scourge
onto the battlefield.

01:28:50.598 --> 01:28:53.366
While me and Elena sneak in
through the back way.

01:28:56.604 --> 01:28:59.006
It sounds like
we're all going to die.

01:29:00.541 --> 01:29:05.179
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting

01:29:05.313 --> 01:29:07.181
all as one.

01:29:19.459 --> 01:29:23.531
This world is yours,
master.

01:29:24.165 --> 01:29:26.000
Scourge,

01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:27.602
they're back.

01:29:32.974 --> 01:29:36.677
Prime.

01:29:37.879 --> 01:29:42.049
Protect the key.
Don't let them get
to the bridge.

01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:03.905
Maximals!

01:30:04.038 --> 01:30:05.573
Autobots!

01:30:05.706 --> 01:30:07.608
Roll out!

01:30:18.451 --> 01:30:21.555
Rhinox, Cheetor, maximize!

01:30:45.079 --> 01:30:46.914
At least
the foot soldiers took the bait.

01:30:47.048 --> 01:30:49.150
Yeah, but Scourge didn't.
He's guarding the key.

01:30:49.283 --> 01:30:53.287
All right.
This should lead to the bottom
of the Transwarp control panel.

01:30:53.421 --> 01:30:56.791
Get the key,
get the hell out of there.
What are you gonna do?

01:30:56.924 --> 01:30:58.893
I'm gonna go distract Scourge.

01:30:59.026 --> 01:31:00.695
No, you can't take on
Scourge alone.

01:31:00.828 --> 01:31:03.764
Relax.
I'm Mirage, remember?

01:31:04.165 --> 01:31:05.633
Hey.

01:31:40.835 --> 01:31:43.104
One, two, three!

01:31:43.237 --> 01:31:45.172
Whoomp! There it is! Pow!

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.575
We gotta hurry up.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.716
Take cover!

01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:58.619
Someone give me a real fight!

01:32:00.755 --> 01:32:03.624
It's a fight you want?
You got one.

01:32:17.838 --> 01:32:20.574
He was mine.

01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:22.877
Nope!

01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:24.545
Missed me!

01:32:26.947 --> 01:32:29.483
Noah, get to the key.

01:32:29.617 --> 01:32:31.218
Mirage!

01:32:31.352 --> 01:32:33.522
What do we have here?

01:32:33.654 --> 01:32:35.524
Elena, go!

01:32:38.793 --> 01:32:43.697
Brave, but futile.

01:32:46.501 --> 01:32:49.570
Hey! Don't mess with my boy!

01:33:12.193 --> 01:33:13.627
Mirage.

01:33:18.799 --> 01:33:22.103
No one will remember
this pathetic planet.

01:33:23.404 --> 01:33:26.373
And no one
will remember you.

01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:31.946
Mirage, what are you doing?

01:33:32.079 --> 01:33:34.215
Keeping my promise.

01:33:34.348 --> 01:33:37.151
Mirage, no!
Come on, you gotta get up!

01:33:37.284 --> 01:33:38.953
It's okay, Noah.

01:33:44.225 --> 01:33:45.826
Home-- Home team.

01:33:47.728 --> 01:33:49.263
Home team.

01:33:52.534 --> 01:33:54.301
Mirage!

01:33:57.171 --> 01:33:58.472
Mirage?

01:34:00.741 --> 01:34:03.612
Mirage.

01:34:04.311 --> 01:34:06.347
Kill the other human.

01:34:43.751 --> 01:34:45.419
Unicron.

01:34:45.554 --> 01:34:47.988
You fought bravely.

01:34:48.122 --> 01:34:52.726
But this world is already mine.

01:35:01.769 --> 01:35:03.370
We're too late.

01:35:12.581 --> 01:35:14.281
Yo!
Hey!

01:35:16.317 --> 01:35:20.988
Hey! Look!

01:35:33.334 --> 01:35:35.869
Hey, Knuckles.

01:35:36.003 --> 01:35:38.839
You there? Over.

01:35:38.973 --> 01:35:40.407
Yo, Sonic.

01:35:40.941 --> 01:35:43.110
Kris!
Noah?

01:35:43.744 --> 01:35:45.279
What's going on?

01:35:45.412 --> 01:35:46.780
Where's Mirage?

01:35:46.914 --> 01:35:50.050
He-- He's gone.

01:35:50.184 --> 01:35:51.819
Gone?

01:35:53.722 --> 01:35:56.457
No.

01:35:58.892 --> 01:36:00.528
I'm sorry, Kris.

01:36:08.002 --> 01:36:09.937
I'm not gonna win this one.

01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:12.507
But you don't lose,
right?

01:36:13.073 --> 01:36:14.808
I wish that were true,

01:36:15.610 --> 01:36:16.844
but I can't.

01:36:23.017 --> 01:36:25.019
Yes, you can.

01:36:25.853 --> 01:36:28.022
No.

01:36:29.591 --> 01:36:31.825
No, man, I'm not you.

01:36:31.959 --> 01:36:33.060
I hate being sick.

01:36:33.193 --> 01:36:34.495
Whenever I wanna give up,

01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:37.364
you're always there
telling me to keep going.

01:36:37.931 --> 01:36:39.333
But now it's my turn.

01:36:39.466 --> 01:36:41.201
Keep going, Noah.

01:36:42.903 --> 01:36:47.341
You think you're a nobody,
but you're the strongest guy
I know.

01:36:47.474 --> 01:36:50.311
You guys are so cute.

01:36:50.878 --> 01:36:51.812
Mirage?

01:36:51.945 --> 01:36:53.615
You're alive!

01:36:53.748 --> 01:36:59.219
Uh, yeah, but...
I'm gonna need you
to take the wheel.

01:37:10.230 --> 01:37:12.299
You can do this.

01:37:16.837 --> 01:37:18.606
'Cause you're my brother.

01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:21.875
Noah Diaz
from Wilson Avenue,

01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:25.479
Apartment 2-C,
Brooklyn, New York.

01:37:28.882 --> 01:37:31.185
No names over the airwaves.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:32.986
Forget that.

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.888
Let 'em know who you are.

01:37:39.393 --> 01:37:40.762
Yo, Scourge!

01:37:45.966 --> 01:37:47.602
Remember me?

01:38:08.322 --> 01:38:11.526
You think
you can take me on alone?

01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:17.030
He is not alone.

01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:04.746
I'm never
leaving Brooklyn again.

01:39:17.191 --> 01:39:20.294
Ah! Energon.

01:39:49.824 --> 01:39:51.358
Prime!

01:39:53.895 --> 01:39:55.128
Noah!

01:40:11.813 --> 01:40:15.148
I'm getting really tired
of you humans.

01:40:48.315 --> 01:40:50.450
Bee!

01:40:55.355 --> 01:40:59.092
You again.
You should've stayed dead!

01:41:21.049 --> 01:41:23.751
I have come here to kick ass.

01:41:23.885 --> 01:41:25.053
Glad to have you back.

01:41:25.185 --> 01:41:27.055
Everyone guard the bridge!

01:41:27.187 --> 01:41:30.024
Elena, shut it down!

01:41:36.263 --> 01:41:38.032
We gotta give her
some cover!

01:41:38.165 --> 01:41:39.801
We'll clear the way.

01:41:42.570 --> 01:41:44.271
That's what
I'm talkin' about.

01:41:44.404 --> 01:41:48.141
Punch in an access code...
How hard could that be?

01:41:51.478 --> 01:41:53.548
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

01:41:59.252 --> 01:42:01.623
Just you and me, Scourge.

01:42:05.827 --> 01:42:09.797
Let's end this
once and for all.

01:42:09.931 --> 01:42:11.566
Master, the reinforcements!

01:42:33.121 --> 01:42:34.221
All right, I got this.

01:42:34.354 --> 01:42:35.288
Let's go, Bee!

01:42:43.798 --> 01:42:46.266
Say hello to my little friend!

01:43:09.222 --> 01:43:10.725
We gotta hurry!

01:43:11.358 --> 01:43:12.527
Last one.

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.797
Die, you ugly mother--

01:43:52.299 --> 01:43:56.003
You will never see Unicron
take this world.

01:44:02.710 --> 01:44:04.277
You did it!

01:44:04.411 --> 01:44:05.913
Brooklyn, baby!

01:44:06.047 --> 01:44:08.082
No!

01:44:08.583 --> 01:44:10.752
Unicron will prevail!

01:44:10.885 --> 01:44:12.486
Elena!

01:44:15.923 --> 01:44:17.859
I've had enough!

01:44:20.528 --> 01:44:24.464
Time to show you
the real power of the Prime!

01:44:28.202 --> 01:44:31.205
This belongs
to a friend of mine!

01:44:44.317 --> 01:44:45.553
The panel,

01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:47.755
it's destroyed.

01:44:48.421 --> 01:44:49.924
I can't stop it.

01:44:51.259 --> 01:44:53.761
Autobots, Maximals,

01:44:53.895 --> 01:44:55.263
retreat to safety.

01:44:55.395 --> 01:44:58.365
I will destroy the key
myself.

01:44:58.498 --> 01:45:00.101
Prime! No!

01:45:00.234 --> 01:45:01.803
There's gotta be another way.

01:45:01.936 --> 01:45:03.704
Bee, protect them.

01:45:12.445 --> 01:45:16.449
Your sacrifice becomes our oath.

01:45:17.084 --> 01:45:19.921
Thank you, my friends.

01:45:23.991 --> 01:45:27.161
Bee!

01:45:27.295 --> 01:45:29.230
We can't leave him!

01:45:35.970 --> 01:45:38.105
Everyone, on me!

01:45:49.817 --> 01:45:51.451
Don't, Prime.

01:45:51.586 --> 01:45:54.856
I can give you
everything you want.

01:45:54.989 --> 01:45:56.224
Then die.

01:46:34.862 --> 01:46:35.796
Noah.

01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:37.464
I got you!

01:46:48.441 --> 01:46:51.178
Let me go, Noah.
Save yourself.

01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:55.783
Till all are one.

01:47:15.703 --> 01:47:17.939
Till all are one.

01:47:30.418 --> 01:47:31.819
Punch it, Prime.

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:00.514
Yeah, baby!

01:48:31.245 --> 01:48:33.581
Unicron...
Is he dead?

01:48:33.714 --> 01:48:36.751
Trapped, but not dead.

01:48:36.884 --> 01:48:39.653
Evil can never
be vanquished completely.

01:48:40.488 --> 01:48:41.922
He could return.

01:48:42.056 --> 01:48:43.791
Let him come.

01:48:43.924 --> 01:48:47.028
United, we will destroy him,

01:48:47.161 --> 01:48:49.196
once and for all.

01:48:52.867 --> 01:48:55.136
I am Optimus Prime,

01:48:55.269 --> 01:48:57.204
leader of the Autobots.

01:48:57.905 --> 01:49:00.041
We have lost the Transwarp Key

01:49:00.174 --> 01:49:03.310
and with it
our ability to go home.

01:49:06.447 --> 01:49:08.716
But we have gained an ally

01:49:08.849 --> 01:49:12.186
in our battle against
the forces of evil.

01:49:12.319 --> 01:49:14.488
Forces too powerful

01:49:14.622 --> 01:49:17.992
for any of us
to defeat on our own.

01:49:18.125 --> 01:49:22.563
But together,
we might just have a chance.

01:49:31.572 --> 01:49:34.475
I am Noah Diaz.

01:49:34.608 --> 01:49:36.777
What is there to know about me?

01:49:36.911 --> 01:49:39.313
I was raised out in Brooklyn.

01:49:39.447 --> 01:49:41.582
I got a little bro
who calls me Sonic.

01:49:41.715 --> 01:49:45.052
And if I gotta help
save the universe in order
to save the people I love,

01:49:45.186 --> 01:49:47.354
well, then that's what
I'm gonna do.

01:50:17.952 --> 01:50:19.053
How you doing, sir?

01:50:19.186 --> 01:50:21.556
Um, I'm here
for the job interview?

01:50:21.689 --> 01:50:22.790
Noah Diaz.

01:50:22.923 --> 01:50:24.758
I'll tell 'em you're here.

01:50:26.494 --> 01:50:28.195
This Sunday on 60 Minutes,

01:50:28.329 --> 01:50:30.965
I sit down to talk
with Elena Wallace.

01:50:31.098 --> 01:50:36.103
She recently discovered
an underground temple
with a network of catacombs...

01:50:36.237 --> 01:50:38.772
...dating back to 5000 BC.

01:50:38.906 --> 01:50:42.710
I never could've imagined
making a discovery
of this significance.

01:50:42.843 --> 01:50:45.813
So it's definitely
a dream come true.

01:50:46.947 --> 01:50:48.215
Brooklyn, baby.

01:50:48.349 --> 01:50:50.519
They're ready for you.

01:50:50.651 --> 01:50:52.820
Thank you, sir.
Elevator in the back.

01:50:57.526 --> 01:50:59.793
Why don't you tell me
about your strengths?

01:50:59.927 --> 01:51:02.029
In addition
to my experience
with electronics,

01:51:02.163 --> 01:51:06.100
I've also been really developing
my team-building skills too.

01:51:07.668 --> 01:51:09.069
Is that so?

01:51:09.203 --> 01:51:12.072
Look, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

01:51:12.206 --> 01:51:14.643
Résumé's a little thin.

01:51:14.775 --> 01:51:17.478
Yeah, well,
I just recently had a job

01:51:18.078 --> 01:51:20.247
working internationally.

01:51:20.381 --> 01:51:21.882
Oh, was that...

01:51:23.684 --> 01:51:25.719
No, I don't think
it's on here.

01:51:25.853 --> 01:51:28.523
No, it was...
it was a short-term contract.

01:51:28.657 --> 01:51:31.158
Oh, well, that's cool.

01:51:31.292 --> 01:51:33.227
Why don't you tell me
about that?

01:51:36.363 --> 01:51:40.067
It was in South America.
So I got to work on my Spanish.

01:51:40.201 --> 01:51:41.603
My mom was real happy
about that.

01:51:41.735 --> 01:51:44.038
You know what I'm saying?
You know moms.

01:51:44.171 --> 01:51:46.907
She's just really--
But while I was out there,
honestly, man,

01:51:47.041 --> 01:51:49.710
it was really just like
work, work, work, you know?

01:51:49.843 --> 01:51:53.781
Ah. That's a shame,
because I hear the food
is really good in Peru.

01:51:56.317 --> 01:51:58.786
Wait, I didn't-- I didn't
mention anything about Peru.

01:51:58.919 --> 01:52:01.055
Well, that's where
you were, right?

01:52:01.188 --> 01:52:03.625
I was--
Down in Cusco?

01:52:03.757 --> 01:52:06.860
With you and, uh, Elena

01:52:07.461 --> 01:52:08.929
and your, um,

01:52:09.063 --> 01:52:11.165
I don't know,
call 'em friends?

01:52:14.603 --> 01:52:16.437
What...

01:52:16.571 --> 01:52:18.205
What's going on in here?

01:52:18.339 --> 01:52:20.808
We know a lot
about you, Mr. Diaz.

01:52:20.941 --> 01:52:24.278
Who are you?
The CIA or FBI or...

01:52:24.411 --> 01:52:27.515
We are a secret
government organization.

01:52:27.649 --> 01:52:29.116
Strictly off the books.

01:52:29.250 --> 01:52:30.985
We specialize
in global threats.

01:52:31.118 --> 01:52:33.988
Planetary loss prevention,
that kind of thing.

01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:37.157
We're in the middle
of an ongoing war,

01:52:37.291 --> 01:52:39.493
and we'd love
to have you join the fight.

01:52:39.628 --> 01:52:41.529
You and your whole team.

01:52:42.263 --> 01:52:43.297
You know,

01:52:44.699 --> 01:52:45.799
the big guys.

01:52:45.933 --> 01:52:48.002
No idea what
you're talking about.

01:52:49.571 --> 01:52:51.272
That's a good answer.

01:52:51.405 --> 01:52:52.641
All right.

01:52:52.773 --> 01:52:55.209
Either way,
I want you to know,

01:52:55.342 --> 01:52:57.545
in lieu of the thanks
of a grateful nation,

01:52:57.679 --> 01:53:00.814
we will be taking care
of your brother Kris's
health care.

01:53:00.948 --> 01:53:02.016
All of it.

01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:04.753
From now on,
he will have 24/7 access

01:53:04.885 --> 01:53:06.721
to the greatest doctors
in the world.

01:53:06.854 --> 01:53:10.457
And these are doctors
who don't ask their patients
about account balances.

01:53:15.496 --> 01:53:16.698
Are you serious?

01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:19.601
You saved the world, kid.
It's the least we can do.

01:53:19.734 --> 01:53:21.368
I don't know what to say.

01:53:21.503 --> 01:53:23.370
We'll work on that.

01:53:24.872 --> 01:53:27.041
Your brother's
gonna be just fine.

01:53:32.647 --> 01:53:34.014
Oh.

01:53:34.148 --> 01:53:36.250
Kris was right, by the way.

01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:47.328
No names over the airwaves.

01:53:48.630 --> 01:53:51.198
We could really use
someone like you, Noah.

01:53:51.332 --> 01:53:53.967
Why don't you think about it?

01:54:15.989 --> 01:54:17.491
"G.I. Joe"?

01:54:54.729 --> 01:54:58.399
Come on, baby,
show me some. Show me some.

01:54:58.533 --> 01:54:59.768
That oughta do it.

01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:03.404
This?

01:55:03.538 --> 01:55:07.241
This is a complete waste of
your skills and my expertise.

01:55:07.374 --> 01:55:09.176
Think it came out pretty good.

01:55:10.411 --> 01:55:12.881
Well, I guess
we could call it modern art

01:55:13.013 --> 01:55:15.082
and sell it
to some cats in SoHo.

01:55:15.215 --> 01:55:16.483
Nah, I'm not selling.

01:55:16.618 --> 01:55:17.652
What?

01:55:18.419 --> 01:55:19.453
Why?

01:55:20.755 --> 01:55:22.456
Is this about the 5-0 thing?

01:55:23.257 --> 01:55:25.727
No. I told you,
I did not ditch you!

01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:28.530
I was running the give-and-go.
I thought you knew the play!

01:55:28.663 --> 01:55:31.866
All right,
let's say I did ditch you,
even though I didn't.

01:55:31.999 --> 01:55:34.435
For your sake--
I see your face--
let's just say I did.

01:55:34.569 --> 01:55:36.604
I think all the blood,
sweat and dead presidents

01:55:36.738 --> 01:55:40.040
I put into getting
these car parts for you
make us even steven.

01:55:40.174 --> 01:55:41.975
It's not that.

01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:43.912
This car is special.

01:55:44.044 --> 01:55:47.314
This car is a jigsaw puzzle
made of garbage!

01:55:47.448 --> 01:55:52.152
Hey, I bet the joint
don't even start.

01:55:54.589 --> 01:55:55.690
Bet?

01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:58.192
Yo, Mirage.

01:56:08.001 --> 01:56:09.169
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:56:09.303 --> 01:56:12.640
Yeah!
Your boy is back!

01:56:12.774 --> 01:56:15.409
This dude said
I wasn't even gonna start!

WEBVTT

00:02:25.583 --> 00:02:26.625
Wait, wait.

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:42.875
We've got at least
16 guards on site, four vehicles primed.

00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:45.916
Konrad's moving guns.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.041
Lots of them.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.750
He's a real piece of work.

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:51.958
He's up to his ears
in scanners and other jamming technology,

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:54.333
so we're gonna lose comms
the moment we're inside.

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:56.916
Question. Do we ever get any days off?

00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:00.583
- You're such a millennial, Nile.
- Hey, it's a fair question.

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:03.416
Nile, we didn't have any days off

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.958
when we were the new ones.

00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:06.875
All right, Joe, Nicky,

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.541
you guys take the hedge maze.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:11.333
What?

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:12.666
Really?

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.000
Don't worry.

00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:17.583
- It's not going to be like 1853.
- What are you guys talking about?

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:19.208
There was a cannon.

00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:20.666
We didn't see it.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.416
It was Booker.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.458
His head was blown clean off by a cannon.
We couldn't find it in the maze.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.666
And he couldn't help, for obvious reasons.

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:34.041
You think he's okay?

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:42.791
Let's do this, guys.

00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:45.958
Let us know if you put eyes on Konrad.

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.000
Two guards have moved to the waterfront.

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:49.750
No sign of the big man yet.

00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:54.625
Hey.

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:05.750
- He's only got one weapon.
- You sure?

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.666
Do I need to remind you
you're not immortal?

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.166
Fair enough.

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:41.208
All right, guys. You know what to do.

00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:43.875
Get as many guards
to chase you as you can.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.500
I make it look good

00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:51.000
I make it look easy...

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.000
- This one is mine!
- No, no, no!

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:57.708
I make it look good

00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:00.000
Last name, Danger

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.791
Got a dead man on my back...

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:07.958
It worked. They're heading your way.

00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:15.291
They're supposed to follow us,
not to catch us.

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:24.750
I make it look easy...

00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:31.958
All right. We're heading in.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.583
Easy

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:35.791
I make it look good

00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:49.541
I make it look good

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:02.916
What? No sex swing?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.458
You must have seen some bad art
in your time, haven't you?

00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.291
This bad? Not in at least a century.

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:11.708
Weapons being loaded.

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:16.166
They're on the move.
Commotion must've spooked 'em.

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:50.333
I need to remind you,
you're not immortal either.

00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:54.625
- Shall I?
- Nope. I always go first.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.166
Nicky.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.291
Slow down, Joe! Slow down!

00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:43.500
Let's give these guys a run.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:02.041
Ah shit!

00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:38.958
Fuck!

00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:32.333
Konrad's upstairs.

00:09:46.833 --> 00:09:48.208
Get in! Get in! Get in!

00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:02.125
Nicolò.

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:24.208
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.500
- Move.
- Stay on my six.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.958
Sixteen guards, huh?

00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:10.625
Go easy.
CIA never taught him how to count.

00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:13.000
Can we just, you know, do this?

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.250
Looks good on you.

00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:21.625
We're all set.

00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:24.458
My CIA contact will be here
in seven minutes.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.458
He'll make sure the weapons are collected.

00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:29.541
Okay, let's start walking.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.750
Whoa! I'm a big bag hunter
With the bow

00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:36.791
She got a big bad dumper, drop it low

00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:39.083
Mama called me
And she happy with the grow

00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:41.833
Never ever fold for a thottie
That's an oath

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.250
Shh!

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:48.625
You gonna call it?

00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:51.458
- I'm thinking.
- She has tells.

00:12:52.041 --> 00:12:53.916
Took me centuries to learn them.
She has tells.

00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:58.958
- No one can read Andy.
- No, I think I can.

00:12:59.041 --> 00:13:00.708
Yeah.

00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.208
- Yeah?
- Oh yeah.

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:05.416
She's telling the truth.

00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:09.250
- Last two rounds.
- Her left eye twitched last two rounds.

00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:12.000
The left eye.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.125
What?

00:13:13.833 --> 00:13:15.625
- Bullshit.
- You sure?

00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.208
Bullshit.

00:13:24.583 --> 00:13:26.125
Thank you.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.375
You know the worst part
about being mortal?

00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:33.541
Just the fucking hangovers.

00:13:35.208 --> 00:13:38.041
Too brutal, man. I don't know.

00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:40.166
- What the...
- I don't know how you do it.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.250
Be right back.

00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.458
Whoo! The drinking is fun.

00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:47.416
- Who you texting?
- It's my new boyfriend.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.625
Come on. Let's go to bed.

00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:53.583
Sure, have another glass.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.958
You'll snore all night like a boar.

00:13:56.041 --> 00:13:57.166
Wow.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.833
You sleep talk all night.

00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:01.958
- Ciao.
- Good night.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.541
You did real good today.

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:09.208
Even though I drove a boat
halfway into the villa?

00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:12.250
Hey, listen, sometimes quick
is better than subtle.

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:14.291
Oh! Today's lesson?

00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:16.708
Yes, it is.

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:24.458
You know, you joke a lot, but...

00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:26.916
how are you doing?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.833
Me?

00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:32.125
I'm really happy.

00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:37.666
I'm at peace.

00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:43.166
Didn't look peaceful when you were
throwing that guy out the window.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.833
It wasn't supposed to be.

00:14:45.875 --> 00:14:46.958
Send it now.

00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:50.416
I mean, I'm mortal. I'm not retired.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.541
My contact confirmed
that Konrad wasn't the buyer.

00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:56.958
Just a conduit,
like the others last month.

00:14:57.041 --> 00:14:59.916
So who is? And what are they doing
with all that artillery?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.916
The real buyer is elusive.
Leaves almost no trace.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.458
This CCTV photo
is all they're able to get me.

00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:08.125
Hey.

00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:11.791
What?

00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:16.458
- You know this woman?
- Yeah.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.666
I mean no. No, I...

00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.666
I think I recognize her.

00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:27.666
I've dreamt about her.

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:31.166
I didn't think it meant anything.
It wasn't clear.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.750
Okay, just... tell me exactly what you saw.

00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:37.375
This woman.

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:39.958
She's, um...

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.875
She's in a room,

00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.791
an ancient room, surrounded by books.

00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:46.916
She's here, isn't she?

00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:53.750
And there's someone else there. A...

00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:55.583
A man, but...

00:15:57.416 --> 00:15:59.208
...I can't see his face.

00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:04.500
But the books, I think they're his.

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:09.541
None of you had a choice.

00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.875
She's hurting him.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.250
And then...

00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:22.291
And then what?

00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.458
And then I wake up.

00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:29.333
Think it means something?

00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:31.125
I don't know.

00:16:32.916 --> 00:16:35.541
There's not enough data yet
to get facial recognition,

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:38.125
but the moment they do, I'll let you know.

00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:40.083
Great. Thanks, Copley.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.458
Hey. Don't worry about this, okay?

00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:49.750
We'll figure it out.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:14.833
Booker.

00:17:17.375 --> 00:17:19.500
It's nice to finally meet you.

00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:32.958
I've been waiting for a very long time.

00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:35.958
Quynh?

00:17:41.458 --> 00:17:42.458
So...

00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:46.875
how do I find Andromache?

00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:17.458
So, do you have any idea where we can go?

00:18:18.083 --> 00:18:20.250
I was thinking of having some time alone.

00:18:21.291 --> 00:18:22.125
Huh.

00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:24.833
Just a little time for myself.

00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:27.458
Okay.

00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:28.541
Thanks.

00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:34.458
You're coming with me.

00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:36.250
I am?

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:37.666
I need your help.

00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:43.000
Try and have some fun without me.

00:18:43.083 --> 00:18:44.708
Bye, boss.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.250
Nile.

00:18:51.583 --> 00:18:52.833
Don't worry, okay?

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:55.500
Enjoy yourself.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.791
What's up with Joe?
Did something happen after the wreck?

00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:17.166
He said he wanted some time alone.

00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:20.916
You're not okay with that?

00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:25.666
I know this man a thousand years.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:27.916
I know when he's lying.

00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.458
- Thank you.
- We're following him.

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:38.333
What?

00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:41.500
Come on.

00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:03.875
Again, do you know where Andromache is?

00:20:05.583 --> 00:20:07.333
It doesn't matter if I do.

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:09.291
I'm in exile.

00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:12.833
- But you can find her.
- Are you listening to what I say?

00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:16.750
I'm exiled.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.750
How'd you find me?

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:23.125
You made it easy.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.500
Staggering around Paris drunk for months.

00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:30.416
It's a miracle you weren't discovered.

00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:34.958
So you bringing me here is...

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.625
is you doing me a favor, right?

00:20:38.875 --> 00:20:40.250
Yeah.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.958
I'm sorry. I'm telling you the truth.

00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:44.583
I'm out of it.

00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:47.583
You wanna know where Andy is?
This is not the way to do it.

00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:56.458
He will need clean clothes.

00:21:13.041 --> 00:21:14.625
Has she spoken of me?

00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:21.625
She never stopped.

00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:28.541
All that time,

00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:31.500
with every last breath I took,

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.166
I imagined she was trapped somewhere

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.916
in the same hell as me.

00:21:38.875 --> 00:21:40.541
All I wanted

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.458
was to get out and release her from it.

00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:50.333
Just to find out

00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:53.416
she'd been free for 500 years.

00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:01.833
She was living in her own kind of hell.

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:05.000
Now, that's hard to believe.

00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:23.208
Merci.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.583
Not much of an exile

00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:35.958
if you're dropping in
to deliver groceries.

00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:44.125
Booker's alone.

00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:47.125
Nicky, caro, what...

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:49.125
- He's alone.
- Yeah.

00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:51.041
And you were the one
screaming for his head.

00:22:51.125 --> 00:22:52.291
We abandoned him.

00:22:52.375 --> 00:22:53.833
He made his choice, Joe,

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:56.458
when he shot Andy and betrayed all of us.

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.958
Guys, something's happened. He's not here.

00:22:59.541 --> 00:23:01.458
There's blood on the wall,
blood on the floors.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.458
When is the last time you talked to him?

00:23:05.666 --> 00:23:08.166
- Joe.
- No reason in pretending now, Joe.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.875
I don't know. A week... a week ago.

00:23:09.958 --> 00:23:12.250
He was fine... I don't...

00:23:12.333 --> 00:23:14.750
We gotta tell Andy,
but it keeps going to voicemail.

00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:17.250
Come on. We'll meet them at Echo.

00:23:19.083 --> 00:23:20.958
- Nicky. Nicky!
- Come on. Come on.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.375
All this way, and you still
haven't told me who it is we're meeting.

00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:36.833
I made a promise the last time I saw him
that I would protect his secret.

00:23:38.458 --> 00:23:40.458
It's just around this corner here.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.583
Actually, I think maybe
I should just check in with him first.

00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:46.208
- Yeah.
- See if this is okay.

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:48.208
Of course. I'll be on call.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:49.666
Okay.

00:24:25.375 --> 00:24:27.541
Andromache.

00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:31.041
You were expecting me?

00:24:32.708 --> 00:24:34.583
Let's just say I'm not surprised.

00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:48.791
Thank you.

00:24:58.833 --> 00:25:01.083
You're still wearing Quynh's necklace.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.041
Do you still dream about everyone?

00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:12.875
I keep tabs.

00:25:13.375 --> 00:25:16.208
- Do you know about Nile?
- Nile Freeman.

00:25:17.166 --> 00:25:18.125
I do.

00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:20.041
Well, she's been dreaming about a woman.

00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:23.583
A woman who was here with you.

00:25:24.083 --> 00:25:26.333
I thought maybe you'd know something.

00:25:29.416 --> 00:25:31.166
Why don't you come to the library?

00:25:33.583 --> 00:25:35.041
I think we should talk.

00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:37.500
So do I.

00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:45.250
You know, Tuah, I almost completely
stopped believing in our purpose

00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:48.958
until a friend of mine discovered
a ripple effect.

00:25:50.625 --> 00:25:51.833
Where's this friend?

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:54.500
So, uh,

00:25:54.583 --> 00:25:55.916
how old are you, then?

00:25:57.416 --> 00:26:00.708
Let's just say 2,300 for a round number.

00:26:01.708 --> 00:26:02.541
You?

00:26:03.166 --> 00:26:04.250
I'm 43.

00:26:05.666 --> 00:26:06.583
Impressive.

00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:29.208
Uh...

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.291
This is...

00:26:37.375 --> 00:26:39.916
all about immortals?

00:26:40.833 --> 00:26:43.791
Yes, our place in history.

00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:46.041
The facts and fictions
that have found their way

00:26:46.125 --> 00:26:48.083
into the writings of cultures

00:26:48.583 --> 00:26:52.125
and civilizations... the world over.

00:26:52.958 --> 00:26:55.208
Evidence of what you found out

00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:57.125
within 43 short years.

00:26:57.208 --> 00:26:58.625
Cause and effect.

00:26:59.125 --> 00:27:00.333
A life saved in Ghana...

00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:05.083
Leads to a Nobel Prize in medicine
three generations later.

00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:07.750
What happened over there?

00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:12.625
Those volumes were stolen by one of us.

00:27:16.916 --> 00:27:18.625
The woman Nile's been dreaming about?

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.083
I've written books
on every single immortal.

00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:25.833
You, your friends, the work that they...

00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:27.375
Who is she, Tuah?

00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:31.125
She's gone by many names over the years.

00:27:31.208 --> 00:27:32.583
She goes by Discord now.

00:27:33.666 --> 00:27:34.750
Sounds ominous.

00:27:34.833 --> 00:27:35.958
As it should.

00:27:37.083 --> 00:27:38.958
She was the first of our kind
that I had met.

00:27:40.041 --> 00:27:41.250
A long time ago.

00:27:41.875 --> 00:27:43.041
How long?

00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:47.291
She is older than any of us.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.833
She is the first of the immortals.

00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:53.750
No.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.166
No, Andromache is the first.

00:27:59.583 --> 00:28:00.833
What are you saying?

00:28:00.916 --> 00:28:03.666
I... I... I found no
trace of anyone earlier.

00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:06.333
- By design.
- What do you mean, "by design"?

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.416
There was a time
where we walked together peacefully.

00:28:11.208 --> 00:28:12.916
But over the centuries,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.625
we saw how fear of those who are different

00:28:15.708 --> 00:28:18.333
can turn even good men cruel.

00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:29.750
We have to do something.

00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:31.916
They're like us.

00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:34.500
Please! No! No!

00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:48.208
Such evil cannot be unseen.

00:28:55.875 --> 00:28:58.541
No! No! No!

00:28:58.625 --> 00:28:59.958
Quynh!

00:29:00.041 --> 00:29:03.125
Quynh!

00:29:04.583 --> 00:29:06.375
That was the day you saved me.

00:29:06.958 --> 00:29:08.041
She was there too?

00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:09.916
Yes.

00:29:12.291 --> 00:29:16.500
Afterwards, I retreated
to my books, my research.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.541
And Discord retreated too.

00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:23.500
Then she spent the next five centuries
amassing untold wealth and power

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.291
so as not to fear enemy or attack.

00:29:27.083 --> 00:29:29.166
Dealing arms with people like Konrad.

00:29:34.708 --> 00:29:36.875
What does she want from us, Tuah?

00:29:36.958 --> 00:29:37.958
I don't know.

00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:40.541
She's not the same person
that I once knew.

00:29:40.625 --> 00:29:44.250
And now that she knows your histories,
your relationships,

00:29:44.833 --> 00:29:47.958
I believe that all of you
could be in danger.

00:29:50.333 --> 00:29:52.500
It's been millennia
since I've been afraid.

00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:56.916
But I am scared of what she is capable of,

00:29:58.083 --> 00:29:59.458
and so should you.

00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:06.666
Tuah.

00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:11.291
Do you think there's a chance

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.916
she might know
that I've lost my immortality?

00:30:17.625 --> 00:30:18.791
How long has it been?

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:23.166
Around six months.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.541
Andromache.

00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:32.666
I think you should pack a bag.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.125
I already have.

00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:41.708
Because I knew what you were gonna say.

00:30:41.791 --> 00:30:43.833
No. You thought you knew what I'd say.

00:30:44.416 --> 00:30:45.583
You lied to us.

00:30:45.666 --> 00:30:46.791
They're back.

00:30:46.875 --> 00:30:48.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:30:50.041 --> 00:30:51.333
Who's this?

00:30:53.875 --> 00:30:56.541
This is Tuah, an old friend of mine.

00:30:56.625 --> 00:30:57.750
"An old friend"?

00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:01.458
You knew there was another,
and you never told us?

00:31:02.916 --> 00:31:04.625
Boss, you lied to us?

00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:06.250
I didn't lie. I...

00:31:06.333 --> 00:31:08.333
A lie of omission is still a lie.

00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:12.291
In Andromache's defense,
I asked her not to tell anyone of me.

00:31:13.916 --> 00:31:15.791
Something's happened to Booker.

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:17.541
What?

00:31:20.333 --> 00:31:22.583
- Did you go see him?
- It's not like that.

00:31:25.041 --> 00:31:28.916
Yusuf went to see him.
They've been talking the entire time.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.833
- We went to his place in Paris.
- Blood everywhere.

00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:34.583
Discord.

00:31:36.166 --> 00:31:37.166
Possibly.

00:31:37.708 --> 00:31:40.916
What else do we know about her?

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.166
I mean, where she lives, her...

00:31:43.875 --> 00:31:45.791
her habits, her MO.

00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:03.125
It's Booker.

00:32:04.583 --> 00:32:06.833
Don't worry, boss. We got this.

00:32:08.833 --> 00:32:09.958
We have to.

00:32:33.416 --> 00:32:34.500
Thanks for coming.

00:32:38.333 --> 00:32:40.083
- Joe.
- Hey.

00:32:43.916 --> 00:32:45.208
- What happened?
- Hmm.

00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:49.125
I need to see Andy.

00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:14.166
Andy.

00:33:18.958 --> 00:33:20.208
She's out.

00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:23.875
What?

00:33:23.958 --> 00:33:25.166
Quynh.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.625
She couldn't find you, so she found me.

00:33:59.583 --> 00:34:01.000
Andromache.

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:04.958
I have returned to a world

00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:08.875
darker than the tomb I finally escaped,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.291
only to learn
you have gone on living in it freely

00:34:16.083 --> 00:34:18.166
all these centuries.

00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:24.583
I need to hear the words
that will free me from my true prison.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.125
That of a broken promise.

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:31.250
You and me.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:33.833
Until the end.

00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:36.916
Find me where you always could.

00:34:44.291 --> 00:34:45.625
I have to go meet her.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.416
- Andy, don't.
- It's Quynh.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.708
Give her space, Nile.

00:34:57.458 --> 00:35:00.375
Andy, she could have reached out to you
in a million ways.

00:35:00.458 --> 00:35:03.166
Instead, she kidnaps Booker
and does all this for face time?

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.333
That seem sane to you?

00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:07.916
For 1,500 years, it was just her and me.
What do you know about her, Nile?

00:35:09.166 --> 00:35:12.000
I know you can die and I can't.

00:35:12.708 --> 00:35:15.208
And I know your head's not on straight
when it comes to her.

00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:18.791
So tell me, if our places were swapped,
would you let me go alone?

00:35:29.791 --> 00:35:31.541
So I guess you must be, uh,

00:35:32.666 --> 00:35:33.666
Tuah, right?

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.750
It's good to meet you finally, Sébastien.

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:38.916
- Do you mind if I call you Booker?
- Whichever you like.

00:35:41.708 --> 00:35:44.000
How long are you guys gonna keep this up?

00:35:44.083 --> 00:35:46.083
This whole cold shoulder bit. Hmm?

00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:48.833
How do we know
you haven't sold us out again, Book?

00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:50.750
Come on.

00:35:56.916 --> 00:35:58.166
Well, I, uh...

00:35:59.833 --> 00:36:01.083
I guess you don't.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.208
Andromache.

00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:32.083
This is not who you are.

00:37:49.833 --> 00:37:51.625
Woke up alone in the car.

00:37:53.083 --> 00:37:54.666
Thought you ditched me.

00:37:55.666 --> 00:37:56.875
Thought about it.

00:37:59.666 --> 00:38:01.208
Anything I can do?

00:38:04.916 --> 00:38:07.375
Can you give me back five centuries?

00:38:09.375 --> 00:38:10.625
Wish I could.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.250
What if she doesn't recognize me?

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.375
I don't mean physically, but...

00:38:35.666 --> 00:38:37.083
who I've become.

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.208
What if I don't recognize her?

00:38:48.083 --> 00:38:50.791
Andy, I've never seen you like this.

00:38:59.791 --> 00:39:02.000
I've been like this for hundreds of years.

00:39:24.875 --> 00:39:26.458
I'll be right behind you.

00:39:29.916 --> 00:39:30.833
Okay.

00:40:06.375 --> 00:40:08.625
Excuse me,
can I use this phone for a second?

00:40:08.708 --> 00:40:09.708
Of course.

00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:43.125
I don't know how to...

00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:49.500
There are no words
to explain how I failed you.

00:41:58.875 --> 00:42:00.666
Can you imagine it?

00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:03.291
Trapped

00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:05.208
in the dark.

00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:08.708
Every muscle

00:42:09.208 --> 00:42:11.250
screaming for air.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.583
My life returning just long enough...

00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:21.208
to remember,

00:42:22.458 --> 00:42:23.333
to hope.

00:42:28.291 --> 00:42:29.750
I'm so sorry.

00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:34.000
I'm so sorry.

00:42:51.583 --> 00:42:53.250
How long have you been back?

00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:55.583
Months.

00:42:56.958 --> 00:42:58.708
Why didn't you come find me sooner?

00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:02.875
You couldn't even find me
in one small area of ocean.

00:43:03.541 --> 00:43:04.791
I searched.

00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:07.791
I did. I searched for centuries...

00:43:07.875 --> 00:43:09.250
But you stopped.

00:43:34.708 --> 00:43:35.625
Quynh.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.250
Look at me.

00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:49.125
You once told me...

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.416
the only thing you fear is being alone.

00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:01.958
The way it was
before we found each other, Andromache.

00:44:05.208 --> 00:44:07.291
- I am alone.
- You're not.

00:44:07.375 --> 00:44:08.625
You have me.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.583
You have Joe and Nicky.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.500
Quynh.

00:44:18.875 --> 00:44:20.000
Come home.

00:44:21.208 --> 00:44:22.458
You can join us.

00:44:22.958 --> 00:44:25.625
You're asking me to join you

00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:28.250
and your endless war?

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.125
Huh?

00:44:30.208 --> 00:44:31.916
Fight beside you?

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.458
Fight for mortals, the ones who drowned me
in a coffin at the bottom of the sea?

00:44:36.958 --> 00:44:39.458
You have no idea

00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:41.833
what has happened.

00:44:45.166 --> 00:44:46.000
I can't...

00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:49.583
I can't leave them.

00:44:54.333 --> 00:44:55.375
I'm not...

00:44:59.625 --> 00:45:00.708
What?

00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:09.625
Looks like you have made your decision.

00:45:09.708 --> 00:45:10.708
Don't.

00:45:12.125 --> 00:45:13.583
Quynh, wait.

00:45:21.916 --> 00:45:23.291
Stay back.

00:45:50.083 --> 00:45:51.041
Quynh.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:04.166
Wait. I don't wanna fight.

00:46:40.833 --> 00:46:45.500
I remember the woman
I gave that necklace to a long time ago.

00:46:47.125 --> 00:46:48.625
And you're not her.

00:47:09.458 --> 00:47:10.541
Shit! Andy.

00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:11.875
Hey!

00:47:14.958 --> 00:47:16.375
Shut it down.

00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:18.416
Discord's here.

00:47:29.708 --> 00:47:31.833
Nile! No, no, no.

00:47:31.916 --> 00:47:33.041
That's Nile?

00:47:37.833 --> 00:47:39.500
What do you know about Nile?

00:47:44.666 --> 00:47:45.791
Discord.

00:47:46.958 --> 00:47:48.500
That's how you got out?

00:47:50.583 --> 00:47:51.958
You're with Discord.

00:48:00.291 --> 00:48:01.541
Stop!

00:48:02.583 --> 00:48:03.666
Stop.

00:48:15.458 --> 00:48:18.916
I curse you for all your lifetimes!

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.333
Clever. Hiding in a church.

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.250
But you can't stay here forever.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.666
I didn't think we'd be meeting so soon.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.750
I was there, you know.

00:49:44.791 --> 00:49:46.083
I can still remember it.

00:49:48.208 --> 00:49:50.833
The acrid stench of hate in the air.

00:49:54.666 --> 00:49:56.083
Tell me, Nile Freeman,

00:49:56.583 --> 00:50:00.708
how does a good Christian girl like you
stomach what Andromache's doing?

00:50:01.291 --> 00:50:03.583
Playing God with mankind.

00:50:04.166 --> 00:50:06.000
We're not playing God.

00:50:06.083 --> 00:50:08.750
We're helping. We're doing what's right.

00:50:09.291 --> 00:50:12.000
Did it feel right
leaving your family behind?

00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:14.458
Letting them think you were dead?

00:50:16.375 --> 00:50:18.125
That's what she made you do, isn't it?

00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:21.291
That was my decision, my choice.

00:50:22.083 --> 00:50:24.000
None of you had a choice.

00:50:24.625 --> 00:50:25.708
Not with her.

00:50:32.208 --> 00:50:35.666
Andromache's obsession
with interfering with human affairs

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.125
is the reason we're hunted.

00:50:39.583 --> 00:50:42.000
You will make your friends stop

00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:43.958
or I will.

00:50:45.416 --> 00:50:48.041
You are the last immortal.

00:50:48.625 --> 00:50:50.833
There will be none born after you.

00:50:57.333 --> 00:51:00.583
And you have a power
you can't even imagine yet.

00:51:04.083 --> 00:51:05.958
One day you'll understand.

00:51:07.291 --> 00:51:11.416
You and I are going to end
immortal interference together.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.958
I'm not doing anything with you.

00:51:14.041 --> 00:51:15.750
We're connected.

00:51:16.708 --> 00:51:18.833
Do you have a birthmark on your left arm?

00:51:25.166 --> 00:51:26.416
The first immortal

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.583
and the last.

00:51:29.458 --> 00:51:31.666
I'll see you soon, Nile.

00:51:57.208 --> 00:51:59.833
Clearly
Discord has the ability to find us.

00:52:01.125 --> 00:52:04.000
But now we have
all the surveillance footage from Rome.

00:52:04.083 --> 00:52:07.208
Next time Discord or Quynh
walks past a camera,

00:52:08.708 --> 00:52:09.916
we'll know where they are.

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:15.250
- Well, that's something.
- What does it mean?

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.625
"I'm the last."

00:52:20.291 --> 00:52:23.000
Discord knows
something about you we don't,

00:52:23.083 --> 00:52:25.125
and we need to figure it out.

00:52:25.666 --> 00:52:28.750
So what do we do about Quynh?

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.333
I don't know.

00:53:33.708 --> 00:53:34.583
Booker.

00:53:35.166 --> 00:53:36.875
Are you working on something?

00:53:39.375 --> 00:53:40.416
Always.

00:53:45.916 --> 00:53:47.000
Tell me something.

00:53:49.458 --> 00:53:50.541
At any point,

00:53:51.583 --> 00:53:53.583
has Nile ever wounded Andy?

00:53:54.583 --> 00:53:56.916
Yeah. When they first met, they fought.

00:53:58.375 --> 00:54:00.416
Uh, Nile stabbed Andy.

00:54:02.666 --> 00:54:03.500
Why?

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.083
Well, I, uh...

00:54:09.708 --> 00:54:14.083
I have a theory that that is the reason
why Andy has lost her immortality.

00:54:16.041 --> 00:54:17.666
What are you talking about?

00:54:18.791 --> 00:54:21.625
Any day, any one of us
could wake up mortal, right?

00:54:24.166 --> 00:54:26.625
Nothing that lives... lives forever.

00:54:33.166 --> 00:54:34.541
There was a legend

00:54:34.625 --> 00:54:37.750
that Discord and I had heard of
centuries ago.

00:54:39.083 --> 00:54:40.375
It tells

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.625
that a wound from the last immortal

00:54:44.708 --> 00:54:49.250
has the power to take away
anyone else's immortality.

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:54.458
So Nile is the reason Andy's mortal?

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Hmm.

00:54:57.291 --> 00:55:01.416
Well, I believe
that Discord is going to use Nile

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.208
to try to kill all of us.

00:55:05.791 --> 00:55:06.958
But there's more.

00:55:07.041 --> 00:55:10.333
The legend also states
that the wounded immortal

00:55:10.416 --> 00:55:14.875
may bestow the gift of immortality
to another before it is lost.

00:55:19.375 --> 00:55:20.541
A transfer.

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:22.416
Precisely.

00:55:23.916 --> 00:55:25.541
But it has to be willingly given.

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:32.000
So Andy could... become immortal again?

00:55:34.708 --> 00:55:37.250
If one of us become mortal, yes.

00:55:40.083 --> 00:55:41.250
But again,

00:55:41.833 --> 00:55:43.208
it's just a theory.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.958
Andy?

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.875
Can I talk to you for a sec?

00:55:54.958 --> 00:55:55.875
Sure.

00:56:01.583 --> 00:56:04.041
I just wanted to tell you,
after all of this is over,

00:56:04.125 --> 00:56:05.625
I'll probably go.

00:56:06.125 --> 00:56:08.625
Don't be stupid, Book. We need you.

00:56:09.916 --> 00:56:11.750
We never should have left you behind.

00:56:13.208 --> 00:56:14.916
You did what you had to do.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.458
I deserved it.

00:56:16.541 --> 00:56:17.541
Sit down.

00:56:20.041 --> 00:56:23.833
You remember the moment you left me?
You told me to have faith.

00:56:25.125 --> 00:56:26.000
Right?

00:56:27.291 --> 00:56:29.416
Well, the thing is, I, uh...

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:30.541
I didn't,

00:56:31.375 --> 00:56:32.666
and it wrecked me.

00:56:34.041 --> 00:56:37.333
Seeing you walk away,
thinking I'd never see you again...

00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:41.458
was, uh...

00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:47.750
But life is funny
'cause here I am talking to you.

00:56:49.208 --> 00:56:51.166
I'm really grateful for that.

00:56:53.791 --> 00:56:56.041
We've known each other too long.

00:56:57.125 --> 00:57:00.500
Yeah, so many things I left unsaid
all the time.

00:57:04.666 --> 00:57:07.333
When you get to do things
over and over again,

00:57:07.416 --> 00:57:10.083
forever, without expiration date, that's...

00:57:10.166 --> 00:57:13.041
that's where you forget
to say things to one another.

00:57:17.625 --> 00:57:19.791
I'd love an expiration date.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:22.833
You know why?

00:57:25.083 --> 00:57:26.833
'Cause it gives meaning.

00:57:30.875 --> 00:57:32.041
What I mean is,

00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:35.250
maybe this is the perfect time
for Quynh to be back.

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:43.333
You wish for something

00:57:44.291 --> 00:57:45.625
for so long...

00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:52.833
but it's just not that simple.

00:57:53.416 --> 00:57:55.791
She's betraying you out of hurt.

00:57:58.375 --> 00:58:00.083
It's not over yet.

00:58:01.083 --> 00:58:03.041
We always make it through.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.583
Have a little faith, Andy.

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:12.791
And get some sleep.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.125
She let you down again.

00:58:45.458 --> 00:58:46.583
I'm sorry.

00:58:53.333 --> 00:58:57.333
I pulled you from the ocean
because I needed you by my side.

00:58:58.666 --> 00:59:01.791
You may have lost Andromache,
but you don't have to be alone.

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:05.250
How can I help you, Quynh?

00:59:07.083 --> 00:59:09.666
I want them to suffer.

00:59:11.458 --> 00:59:14.166
Andromache and the others, they will.

00:59:17.125 --> 00:59:17.958
No.

00:59:21.083 --> 00:59:22.500
Everyone.

00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:27.166
That I can help you with.

01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:29.250
Drop your weapons.

01:02:28.625 --> 01:02:30.083
Show me what you got.

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.166
Really?

01:02:36.416 --> 01:02:37.666
Why not?

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:39.833
I might be a couple of hundred years old,

01:02:39.916 --> 01:02:41.750
but I can still teach you a thing or two.

01:02:41.833 --> 01:02:44.250
Oh, you're gonna
teach me something? All right.

01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:56.208
Okay, Book.

01:02:58.166 --> 01:02:59.083
Hey, Tuah.

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.708
You're just in time to watch me
school this old man.

01:03:01.791 --> 01:03:04.208
- Go easy on me. It's been a while.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:06.375
Perhaps you're not ready for this, Booker.

01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:07.458
All right.

01:03:17.666 --> 01:03:19.500
How am I doing, Tuah?

01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:21.625
You're a natural.

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:23.708
I would like a chance too.

01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:26.291
Nah, let me play a little.

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:27.625
I insist.

01:03:31.833 --> 01:03:32.708
All right.

01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:08.000
Shit.

01:04:08.083 --> 01:04:09.083
Argh!

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:10.416
Sorry, Book.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.625
No, it's all right.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.041
That was fun.

01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:20.458
I'm gonna take care of this.

01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:21.625
All right.

01:04:22.791 --> 01:04:24.041
I'll be back.

01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:31.958
You shouldn't have done that.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:35.583
I told you it was just a theory.

01:04:35.666 --> 01:04:37.708
Only a theory.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:42.416
I can already tell.
It's... it's not healing.

01:04:47.208 --> 01:04:48.958
Then we don't have much time left.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:53.166
Remember, it must be given willingly.

01:04:56.541 --> 01:04:59.291
Tuah, you understand

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:01.333
Andy can't know about this.

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:04.791
She can't.

01:05:05.875 --> 01:05:07.000
Promise me.

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:22.791
They're just outside Jakarta.

01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:25.041
We need to get everyone together
in the library.

01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:26.666
I'll be right there.

01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:31.125
You do something stupid again?

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:33.958
Yeah, well, you know me.

01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:35.833
As usual.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.125
Copley wants us to meet downstairs.

01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:41.125
All right.

01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:13.333
You okay?

01:06:13.416 --> 01:06:15.000
Yeah.

01:06:15.083 --> 01:06:17.500
It's just been a while, you know.
It's not for me.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:20.625
Meet you downstairs.

01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:36.666
The nuclear facility is a black site.

01:06:37.416 --> 01:06:40.458
Privately owned by the Chinese
on Indonesian soil.

01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:41.958
It's not meant to exist.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.458
The confusion could be helpful.

01:06:44.958 --> 01:06:45.833
Yes.

01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:50.458
This is the security footage
that my contacts were able to obtain

01:06:50.541 --> 01:06:54.833
before all outside contact was cut off.

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:03.208
We have to assume that her black ops team

01:07:03.291 --> 01:07:05.041
has full control of the system,

01:07:05.541 --> 01:07:07.625
from the control room
to the coolant chamber.

01:07:09.416 --> 01:07:11.000
Now, look at the large structure here.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.833
It's the core.

01:07:12.916 --> 01:07:14.833
It appears that, inside here,

01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:16.166
they've, uh,

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.750
planted a device.

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:28.083
We should assume that
it could create an explosion that would...

01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:31.500
breach the facility.

01:07:31.583 --> 01:07:34.791
And irradiate the entire area.

01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:36.375
Ten million people.

01:07:37.666 --> 01:07:39.916
They've planted shaped charges

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.166
capable of incapacitating any one of you

01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:47.083
for an extended
and vulnerable period of time.

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:48.958
It's a trap.

01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:51.875
Discord is using the bomb like bait.

01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:56.083
She knows we'll try to stop her,
and we're playing right into her hands.

01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:57.958
That's exactly what she told me.

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.041
She wants us.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.375
All of us.

01:08:04.166 --> 01:08:06.666
Whatever their motives are,
a bomb is a bomb.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:09.916
And both of them are willing to blow it
to get what they want.

01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:13.000
We don't have a choice.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:15.333
We have to go.

01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:18.041
Gear up.

01:08:29.833 --> 01:08:30.833
Thanks.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:58.583
Do you remember that game we used to play
in Ireland at the Cliffs of Moher?

01:09:00.125 --> 01:09:01.000
Yeah.

01:09:01.583 --> 01:09:03.041
Running towards the edge?

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:06.125
See who chickens out first?

01:09:06.625 --> 01:09:08.000
You never gave up.

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:10.708
No.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.041
Talk to me.

01:09:20.166 --> 01:09:22.041
I can't shake this fear, Nicky.

01:09:24.958 --> 01:09:26.375
And what are you afraid of?

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.625
We could end.

01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:37.875
You know, Andromache,
she walks 3,000 years alone

01:09:37.958 --> 01:09:39.583
before she found Quynh.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.916
But me and you,
we were together from the start.

01:09:44.416 --> 01:09:48.250
I can't look at us
and believe it is arbitrary.

01:09:52.125 --> 01:09:53.291
Things end.

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:56.500
What I feel when I see you,

01:09:58.041 --> 01:09:59.583
when I see your heart...

01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:04.416
that's truly immortal.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.833
It would be ill-advised

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:52.791
to discharge any firearm
in the vicinity of the core.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:55.625
James, negative contact.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:58.625
Yeah, that means
you'll meet resistance further in.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.583
Remember, we have to assume
they have our positions at all times.

01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:09.791
Okay, doors on the south side.

01:11:10.708 --> 01:11:12.416
Through them, up the stairs.

01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:25.958
Stay along the wall and you're
in the upper levels of the reactor.

01:11:31.541 --> 01:11:32.583
Any movement?

01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:36.416
- Still nothing.
- Joe, anything on your side?

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.625
Negative contact on this side too.

01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:43.916
Shaped charge.

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:49.875
Expect additional
small explosives throughout the compound.

01:11:50.458 --> 01:11:54.083
Maybe they're not stupid enough
to stay in a nuclear facility,

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:56.625
now that they've set a bomb to blow it up.

01:12:30.375 --> 01:12:32.708
Okay, they wanna go hand-to-hand.

01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:35.291
Remember, there's always an asshole.

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:46.541
Go, go, go! Move!

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.166
Nicky, get up!

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:43.958
Get to the control room. Open that door.

01:13:49.375 --> 01:13:51.083
Copley, which way do we go?

01:13:51.166 --> 01:13:54.041
All right. Okay.
Down the hall, through the corridor.

01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:56.041
It'll wrap around to the control room.

01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:35.000
I found the asshole.

01:14:50.125 --> 01:14:52.416
Andy!

01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:08.166
Nile!

01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:22.958
Nile?

01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:27.541
If I can get into their system,
I can lead you to the bomb.

01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:29.250
We haven't much time.

01:15:35.125 --> 01:15:38.625
- The system has a firewall.
- Look for a manual override.

01:15:39.958 --> 01:15:41.583
There's no manual override, Copley.

01:15:52.166 --> 01:15:53.916
This was her plan all along.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.125
Discord wants to separate us.

01:16:11.541 --> 01:16:12.541
Copley?

01:16:46.416 --> 01:16:48.833
Tuah? Nicky? Joe?

01:16:48.916 --> 01:16:50.041
Nile.

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:12.000
We're blocked.

01:17:12.083 --> 01:17:13.000
This way.

01:17:16.166 --> 01:17:18.000
Joe, Nicky, Nile!

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.916
They're gone, Book.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.916
Discord is watching us.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.666
Let's go.

01:17:32.791 --> 01:17:36.208
She's controlling the doors.
She's trying to split us up.

01:17:38.583 --> 01:17:41.458
Book, when this door opens,
you have to go first.

01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:42.708
No, no, no. You go first.

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:44.875
They're gonna slaughter me
if I go out there.

01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:45.875
You always go first.

01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:47.000
I'm not joking.

01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:48.375
Me neither, Andy.

01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:52.125
What?

01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:54.666
- I gave it to you.
- How?

01:17:55.625 --> 01:17:56.666
Stay behind me.

01:18:18.708 --> 01:18:21.125
I got my expiration date.

01:18:21.916 --> 01:18:23.833
You have a purpose.

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:27.083
This is mine.

01:18:28.416 --> 01:18:29.541
Book!

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.208
No! Book!

01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:56.000
No!

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.125
Book!

01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:29.791
Book, I...

01:19:37.708 --> 01:19:39.041
Sébastien.

01:21:10.125 --> 01:21:11.125
You're alone.

01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:14.125
Give me the bomb, Quynh.

01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:16.458
Just go with Discord.

01:21:17.125 --> 01:21:18.541
Give her what she wants.

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:20.375
She wants us dead.

01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:25.833
You stood with Andy for centuries.

01:21:26.333 --> 01:21:28.125
Centuries.

01:21:28.208 --> 01:21:30.833
How could you betray her like this?

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:39.875
You know nothing about me and Andy.

01:22:12.083 --> 01:22:13.083
What...

01:22:20.125 --> 01:22:21.166
I'm not...

01:22:22.875 --> 01:22:23.833
I'm not healing.

01:22:24.416 --> 01:22:25.500
Quynh...

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:27.208
What have you done to me?

01:22:27.291 --> 01:22:28.583
I didn't...

01:22:30.916 --> 01:22:32.458
I'm sorry.

01:22:39.625 --> 01:22:41.083
Shh.

01:22:41.166 --> 01:22:42.333
It's okay.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.791
Nile! Joe!

01:23:49.916 --> 01:23:51.000
Nicky!

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:52.791
Tuah!

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:59.708
Is this where you tell me
that this isn't who I am?

01:25:08.041 --> 01:25:10.250
I used to think it was my job to save you.

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:13.666
But in the end,

01:25:14.666 --> 01:25:18.375
each one of us has to decide for ourselves
who we really are.

01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:15.916
Where is she taking them, Quynh?

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:18.583
Where?

01:26:19.666 --> 01:26:20.750
I don't know.

01:26:31.333 --> 01:26:33.041
Bags loaded. Let's go!

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:46.083
Circle around!

01:29:55.625 --> 01:29:56.916
Your hand isn't healing.

01:30:01.458 --> 01:30:02.375
You're mortal.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.416
This had nothing to do
with immortal interference, did it?

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.041
Don't look at me like that.

01:30:10.166 --> 01:30:12.750
Do you know what it's like
to wake up after an eternity

01:30:12.833 --> 01:30:15.166
and find yourself suddenly mortal?

01:30:16.416 --> 01:30:18.375
Every minute

01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:20.583
is a step towards death.

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:23.333
Time means nothing

01:30:24.416 --> 01:30:26.166
until it means everything.

01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:29.625
Time means nothing
if you give it no meaning.

01:30:34.458 --> 01:30:37.500
Your friends don't have
much time left, Andromache.

01:30:41.125 --> 01:30:42.416
That's your plan?

01:30:43.791 --> 01:30:44.958
You're gonna kill them?

01:30:45.458 --> 01:30:46.458
No.

01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:48.875
Nile will.

01:30:49.708 --> 01:30:51.375
She's a destroyer.

01:30:52.291 --> 01:30:54.541
She can take their immortality...

01:30:58.958 --> 01:31:00.500
and give it to me.

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.208
She'll never hurt them.

01:31:06.458 --> 01:31:08.458
You think I'm gonna give her a choice?

01:31:19.958 --> 01:31:22.458
You think your life means more
than one of theirs?

01:31:23.291 --> 01:31:25.333
To me, it does.

01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:29.375
I suspect the first few won't be willing.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.166
And then again,

01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:37.000
torture goes a long way.

01:31:57.791 --> 01:32:00.000
I will come for them!

01:32:00.083 --> 01:32:03.583
And when you do,
the playing field will be level.

01:35:16.583 --> 01:35:20.583
There's a lot... I hate about this century,

01:35:21.208 --> 01:35:22.333
but this

01:35:23.125 --> 01:35:23.958
I like.

01:35:39.958 --> 01:35:42.416
I never knew Discord was mortal.

01:35:47.291 --> 01:35:48.708
I'm gonna find them.

01:35:50.625 --> 01:35:52.125
The only question is...

01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:57.250
are you gonna do what you do best
and fight by my side?

01:36:00.875 --> 01:36:01.708
No.

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.958
You will fight by my side.

01:36:17.833 --> 01:36:21.333
- Where do you think you're going?
- I always go first.

01:36:21.416 --> 01:36:23.375
Not anymore, you don't.

01:36:23.458 --> 01:36:24.500
Try and keep up.

01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:26.291
- Oh yeah?
- Yep.

01:36:37.916 --> 01:36:40.250
I could feel it
I won't come down

01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:46.208
Found myself above the sky

01:36:48.958 --> 01:36:53.166
Tell my mama, tell my daddy

01:36:55.333 --> 01:36:58.875
That love is falling from the sky

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.833
La, la, la-la, la-la

01:37:07.458 --> 01:37:10.125
La, la, la-la, la-la

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.460
Who are you?

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.646
What is this?

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:37.313
Your Majesty, caught him up
in a fishing net. A fishing net.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.391
Sire, he's been telling stories.
Stories that...

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.460
We believe he's found a...

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.369
Ponce de León.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.838
Says he found
Ponce de León's ship.

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:58.705
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.143
Ponce de León died 200 years ago.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:04.808
Aye, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.216
The Fountain of Youth.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:16.090
How soon can you sail?

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.524
With the tide.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.778
Over here!
Lucky heather!

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.987
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.556
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing!

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.557
Pirate puppets!

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:49.218
Take that, you!

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.193
Hurry, Papa, or we'll miss the hanging!

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:54.994
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:56.795
Pirate hanging today!

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:01.639
Come on. Up you get.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.539
Move along, pirate.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.078
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.446
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.450
Quiet! Order!

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.321
Quiet!

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:19.921
Now appearing before the court,

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.290
the notorious and infamous
pirate, pillager,

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.828
- and highwayman...
- Quiet!

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.659
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:34.430
I told you, the name's Gibbs!
Joshamee Gibbs!

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.371
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye!

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:37.839
Presiding over these trials,

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:43.609
all rise and attend,
the Right Honorable Justice Smith!

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.159
My dear sir.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.128
Quiet!

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.692
Now...

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.072
...what do we have here?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.537
Jack?

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:10.165
Shut up!

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.977
I don't recognize him.

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:15.308
Not necessary. You were saying?

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:18.076
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.151
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.015
Is that so?

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.181
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told 'em.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.488
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would
be happy to identify to the court

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:31.529
- if it would help my case.
- I think that would be a poor defense,

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:34.360
unless you want to be bludgeoned again
like a harp seal.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.661
The prisoner claims of being innocent

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.204
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.065
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.734
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.743
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.575
Hang him! String him up!

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.379
- Guilty?
- That's not fair!

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:57.750
Shut it.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:02.789
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of which
you've been found guilty of

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:05.692
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.229
I hereby commute your sentence,

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.030
and order that you be imprisoned
for the remainder

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.037
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.107
- What?!
- Hang him!

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.436
- Hang him!
- There.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.941
- Balderdash!
- String him up! Hang him high!

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:25.244
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.410
to the Tower of London.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.231
Thanks very much.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:45.798
Ta.

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:52.237
Come on. Get up there.

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:56.377
Get up!

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:04.716
Hell's teeth.
Now we're both headed for prison.

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:07.520
Not to worry.
I've paid off the driver.

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:11.060
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London Town, horses waiting.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.722
Tonight, we make the coast.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:15.198
Then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.131
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.206
I arrived in London Town
just this morning

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:24.502
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs
from one appointment with the gallows.

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:26.441
Seeing as how you're still alive,

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.309
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.176
What happened to you, Gibbs?

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:33.877
I thought you were employed elsewhere
or otherwise engaged.

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:37.511
Aye. But I always listened like a thief
for news of the Black Pearl.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:40.125
Nobody's seen where
she might next make port.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.318
Then, I hear a rumor:

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.954
Jack Sparrow's in London
with a ship and looking for a crew.

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.827
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.197
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.860
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:55.235
- Am not!
- Well, I thought it a bit odd,

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:59.105
but then, you've never been
the most predictable of sorts.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.241
Tell me something.

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:04.906
There is another Jack Sparrow out there
sullying my good name?

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.211
- An impostor.
- Indeed.

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:11.119
But... an impostor with a ship.

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:13.818
And in need of a crew.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.985
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.588
What about you, Jack?

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:22.598
Last I heard, you were hell-bent
to find the Fountain of Youth.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.258
Any luck?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.274
Circumstances arose
and forced a compelling insight

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.410
regarding discretion and valor.

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:34.672
- Meaning, you gave up.
- I did not.

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:37.612
I am just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:42.584
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.382
Short trip.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:58.362
All part of the plan, yes?

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:02.565
No.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:34.059
You are Jack Sparrow?

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.798
There should be a "Captain"
in there somewhere.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.461
I've heard of you.

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:41.664
And you know who I am.

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:45.269
Face is familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:49.178
You are in the presence of George
Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.182
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:55.719
King of Great Britain and Ireland,
and of you.

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:59.555
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:04.152
you have come to London
to procure a crew for your ship.

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.431
Vicious rumor. Not true.

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:09.693
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:13.066
I am Jack Sparrow,
but I'm not here to procure a crew.

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.639
That is... someone else.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:20.336
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.242
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.

00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:26.681
Find the proper one
and dispose of this impostor.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:28.878
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.421
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.252
And I am in London.

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:35.451
To procure a crew.

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:37.323
To undertake a voyage

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.897
- to the Fountain...
- What?

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:43.593
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:44.896
Come, come.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.773
We know you're in possession of a map.

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:53.072
So confiscate the map,
and to the gallows with him!

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.077
Have you a map?

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:02.454
- No.
- Where is it?

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:06.285
The truth? I lost it.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:10.418
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:14.158
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:19.430
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:24.168
a Catholic, gain eternal life!

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:28.712
You do know the way to the Fountain?

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:30.975
Of course I do.
Look at me.

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:32.982
You could guide an expedition.

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:37.647
With your permission, your heinie,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.190
you will be providing, then, a ship...

00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:43.459
...and a crew?

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.121
And a captain.

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.977
Afternoon, sire.

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:09.352
If I may be so bold,
why is that man not in chains?

00:13:09.488 --> 00:13:11.422
He must be manacled at once.

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:15.153
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:17.455
Hector.

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:21.088
How nice to see a fellow pirate
make good of himself.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.363
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:30.100
On a sanctioned mission under the
authority and protection of the Crown.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:33.701
As may be, but first,

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:36.041
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:39.310
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:41.715
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:45.790
I defended her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:55.889
If that ship be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

00:13:56.035 --> 00:14:01.337
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,
the Spanish outdistance us.

00:14:01.473 --> 00:14:04.909
I have every confidence
you will prevail and be rewarded

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:07.376
with the high station you so desire.

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:12.280
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.751
Jack, our sands be all but run.

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:19.221
Where's the harm
in joining the winning side?

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:23.158
And you do meet
a nicer class of person.

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.696
I understand everything.

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:28.397
Except that wig.

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:37.867
He's getting away!
Stop him!

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.605
- Head him off!
- No! Stop that pirate!

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.593
Come down!

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:18.283
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:27.123
Guards! Guards!

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.383
- Arms at ready!
- Aye, sir!

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.917
Find him!

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.612
Finders keepers!

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:25.979
There!

00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:50.772
Is that it?

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:57.445
Halt! Stop that carriage!

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:58.878
Head him off!

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:09.520
Out of the way!

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:38.550
Stop that pirate!

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:42.250
Move out of the way!

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:50.229
Stop that man!

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.898
Don't let him get away!

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:02.144
Fire!

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:33.776
He's getting away!
After him! Stop him!

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.646
After him!

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.425
Filthy pirate.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.672
Hello, Jackie.

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:07.869
Hello, Dad.

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.483
I heard you're putting together a crew.

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:21.491
If enough people keep saying it,
it must be true.

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:24.391
I heard where you're headed.
The Fountain.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.020
Have you been there?

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:30.196
Does this face look like
it's been to the Fountain of Youth?

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:34.834
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain.

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:38.807
There'll be items required
for the profane ritual.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.572
Two chalices.

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:44.747
- On the map there was a chalice.
- Two, silver.

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:47.750
From the Ponce de León ship.
You'll need both.

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:51.515
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:54.717
Find out every detail
before you set sail.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.725
Oh, set sail. Love to.

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.092
But for that, I may need a ship.

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:02.530
Those folk, over there,
they have a ship.

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:05.228
They're signing up sailors right now.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.565
My heart is pierced by Cupid

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.697
I disdain all glittering gold

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:12.207
And one last thing, Jackie.

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:16.912
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.380
My heart is pierced by Cupid

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:20.451
I disdain all glittering gold

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:23.316
There is nothing can console me

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:26.082
But my jolly sailor bold

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:41.434
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:43.632
Aye. That is,

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:47.575
Jack Sparrow be putting together
a modest venture.

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:51.646
You got some nerve, ain't ya?

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:53.307
Turning up here dressed like that?

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:55.443
What are you, some kind of impostor?

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.782
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:01.591
Oi, muckers!

00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:04.321
There's a bloke here what's
forgotten his own name!

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:09.362
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:11.297
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:14.929
Who's next?

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:26.442
Bring us some more of those ones.

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.780
Yeah, make it four.

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:41.358
You've stolen me,
and I'm here to take meself back.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.165
Stop doing that.

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:51.123
Only one person alive knows that move.

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:00.996
Always wanted to do that.

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:03.734
Hello, Angelica.

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:10.013
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:13.345
I think I almost killed you
once or twice there.

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:17.546
I'm touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.220
But why?

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:24.021
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

00:24:24.162 --> 00:24:25.891
That is not a compliment.

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:31.996
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:37.302
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:41.344
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.007
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:49.177
they're willing to put up with
any number of peculiarities.

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:53.018
There is one peculiarity
with which I will not put up with.

00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:56.718
I will be impersonated as "Captain."
Nothing less.

00:24:56.862 --> 00:24:58.887
Well, for that, you need a ship,

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.521
and as it turns out, I have one.

00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:04.401
I could use a ship.

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:07.266
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:09.566
There be a lot of hear-telling
going on these days.

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:14.236
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:17.143
You still have a few usable years left.

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:20.610
Always so charming.

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:21.877
You didn't answer me.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.580
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:28.352
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows
of an officious-looking nature.

00:25:28.493 --> 00:25:31.155
Wretched pirates!
Find 'em! Maggots!

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:36.527
Friends of yours?

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:39.296
I may have unintentionally
slighted some king or other.

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.234
Open it!

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:44.035
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?

00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:45.540
Yes.

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.372
Open this door,
in the name of His Majesty.

00:25:47.512 --> 00:25:50.879
You betrayed me.
You seduced me and you used me.

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:52.745
I was innocent of the ways of men.

00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:56.183
You demonstrated a lot of technique
for someone I supposedly corrupted.

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:59.086
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:00.851
Open it!

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:04.553
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:07.324
What were you doing in
a Spanish convent, anyway?

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:10.229
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.799
- There he is!
- Over there!

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:36.159
We are at a disadvantage.

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:39.695
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend to be,

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:41.627
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:43.233
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:22.998
How can you say I used you?

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:25.336
You know exactly how.

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:28.605
I know, but how can you say it?

00:27:33.251 --> 00:27:36.743
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:38.411
About the Fountain.

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.050
What do you know?

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:45.621
You don't happen to be in possession

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.995
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de León?

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:51.566
- No.
- Thought not.

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:55.332
- Why?
- I hear stories.

00:27:55.473 --> 00:27:57.304
Rumors.

00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:59.570
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:01.637
Yes, I am.

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:06.712
What is it?
What is required?

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:13.313
A mermaid, Jack.

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.698
There's been a mistake.

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:26.361
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:35.109
- Barbossa.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:38.238
I trust you can tie a noose.

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:39.782
That's a hard thing,

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:42.910
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.

00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:46.588
You must lie in your bed
the way you made it.

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:49.791
What's happened to you?

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:53.364
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:54.932
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:57.432
The HMS Providence
sets sail at first light.

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.730
If you do not care to watch it
hanging here dead,

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:01.896
with a mouth full of flies...

00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:05.168
...speak now.

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:09.402
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:14.382
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:17.512
Is that where Jack be headed?

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:21.716
Have you anything
you can offer me, Gibbs?

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:23.384
Anything at all?

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:28.655
Upon me naked word,
you'll not see the dawn.

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:38.437
Hand it over.

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.479
- You fool!
- I had just enough time

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:48.108
to study those infernal circles.

00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:52.883
Every route, every destination.
All safe... in here.

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:58.419
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy,
Master Gibbs.

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:13.500
Show a leg, sailor!

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:14.873
Aye, sir.

00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:17.711
What?

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:21.046
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.

00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:25.523
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea,

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.591
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.989
No memory of the night afore,
whence he signed up

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:31.652
and drank away all his bonus money.

00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:33.787
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:36.332
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:39.027
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.
Now, keep moving.

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:49.012
Scrum.

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:51.377
Get your elbows in!

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:55.750
Why is there a glass coffin?

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:58.355
Do I look like a man in charge?

00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:01.424
- Where am I?
- 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:03.220
I be right honored
to welcome you aboard

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:06.626
our world-renowned vessel of infamy,
Queen Anne's Revenge.

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:11.695
Blackbeard.

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.917
Work!

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:37.456
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.254
Zombiefied.

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:43.890
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers are the same.

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.764
Makes 'em more compliant.

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:49.006
And perpetually ill-tempered.

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:53.302
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:04.014
Pull! Pull! Pull!

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:11.119
Five days underway, at least.

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:15.096
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:16.962
Smell of the crew.

00:32:20.538 --> 00:32:23.632
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:25.800
And how can I make sure to not?

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:28.276
Him? Churchly fellow.

00:32:28.413 --> 00:32:30.438
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:32.310
Bible-thumper on this ship?

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.350
A missionary is his story.

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:37.249
What I heard was
he got captured in a raid.

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:40.256
Rest of the ship got killed,
but not 'im.

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:41.689
First mate wouldn't let it happen

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:44.522
on account of his premier standing
with the Lord.

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:49.065
A first mate sticking her neck out
for some prisoner.

00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:50.825
That you don't see.

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:53.665
"Her"? First mate is a "her"?

00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.033
Back to work!

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:06.613
Steady as she goes.

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:25.201
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:28.828
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship,

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:31.771
upon which I am now imprisoned.

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.911
We can do this, Jack.

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:38.641
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:43.881
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.

00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:46.183
Resurrector of the dead
in his spare time.

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:49.191
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:52.228
Maybe to his own daughter?

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:57.701
Daughter as in... beget by?

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:02.403
Long-lost. Recently found.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.374
Who loves her dear papa
with all her soul.

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:08.570
- He bought that?
- I sold that.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.817
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.822
or him and you, not you and me.

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:23.051
No, Jack, that's the best part.

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:25.253
He will be dead.

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.964
You'll be handling
that part yourself, then?

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.364
There is a prophecy.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.699
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:36.296
Oh, no, no.
I've seen a thing or two.

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:42.835
The prophecy is this:

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:46.814
Blackbeard will meet his death
within a fortnight

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:50.409
at the hands of a one-legged man.

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:52.750
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:11.837
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:15.070
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.943
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:24.521
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, Master Gibbs.

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:26.782
And in the king's name,
we behave as such.

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:29.757
Aye, Captain.

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:35.962
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.696
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:48.508
The Spaniard.

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:54.814
All hands! Battle stations!
Get to windward!

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:58.012
- All hands, windward!
- Harden up two points!

00:35:58.156 --> 00:36:01.592
- Two points!
- Cast loose the cannons!

00:36:05.563 --> 00:36:09.329
- Gunners, take posts!
- Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:13.335
- Out! Thrust!
- Await orders.

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:16.804
Steady!

00:36:18.142 --> 00:36:19.734
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:29.077
Sir. Orders, sir?

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:38.423
He never so much as turned his head.

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:40.428
The Fountain is the prize.

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:44.194
It appears we be not even worth
the time it'd take to sink us.

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:48.237
And now we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!

00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:50.932
All hands, more sail!

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:54.408
Ride hard between wind and tide!

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:07.983
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:10.556
Mutiny most foul.

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:14.222
Aye. I signed up to sail
under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:15.627
And a lady, at that.

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.961
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:20.468
Make my toes curl, they do.

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:23.665
I got 'em. All of them.

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:25.775
- Well done.
- Good lad.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.344
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:30.946
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:33.880
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:37.216
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.555
He must come out sometime.

00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:43.620
Not really, no.

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:47.158
Any of you sail with him before?

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:48.765
- No, no.
- I've never.

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:49.923
Definitely not.

00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:53.935
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:57.700
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:59.900
no one's seen him...

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:03.046
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not Blackbeard's ship.

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:05.011
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:07.174
No, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge,
right enough.

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:08.785
How do you know?

00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:12.184
I've seen the name,
on the back of the ship.

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:20.386
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:24.260
...you have been monstrously deceived.

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:28.532
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:31.608
You've nay been informed
of a destination.

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:33.870
Death lies before us

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:38.846
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.346
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:46.616
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:50.091
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless...

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:52.752
...we take the ship.

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:57.626
We take the ship, then. Now!

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:03.363
Go on, then.

00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:06.769
- Help me, shipmates!
- Give it to 'em!

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:09.174
- Wake up! It's ours!
- Come on!

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:10.974
Get up! Off your backside!

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:14.882
- Get off your fannies!
- Take it to them, lads!

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.850
Help me! Fight!

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:31.800
Jack.

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:38.067
If this is a dream,
you can keep the sword and boots on.

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:42.736
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.

00:39:48.352 --> 00:39:49.410
No, it's not!

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:53.281
I thought I should give you
fair warning, we're taking the ship.

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:55.815
Nothing personal.

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:58.794
Think you might be better off
if you just...

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:01.762
...stay out of it.

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:26.653
Boggit.

00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:49.544
Wretch!

00:41:19.176 --> 00:41:21.167
You're either with us or against us!

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:23.507
I am not with you,
neither am I against you!

00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:25.012
Can he do that?

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:28.175
He's religious.
I believe it's required.

00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:36.824
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes!

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:51.039
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight!

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:07.518
The ship is ours!

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:38.583
Gentlemen.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.522
I be placed in a bewilderment.

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:54.297
There I were, resting,

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:59.102
and upon a sudden,
I hear an ungodly row on deck.

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:04.113
Sailors abandon their posts

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:06.773
without orders, without leave.

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:11.116
Men before the mast,

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:13.655
taking the ship for themselves.

00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:17.690
What be that, First Mate?

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:20.694
- Mutiny, Captain.
- Again?

00:43:20.864 --> 00:43:23.833
- Mutiny!
- Aye.

00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:26.096
Mutiny.

00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:32.042
And what fate befalls mutineers?

00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:35.701
Now, we know the answer to that,
do we not?

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:39.440
Mutineers hang!

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:30.995
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.095
I can name fingers and point names.

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:35.738
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:39.104
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:46.710
Have I mentioned, sir,
what a lovely daughter you have?

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:49.785
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:52.353
Remember, Father.
We need him.

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:53.979
If I don't kill a man
every now and then,

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:56.525
- they forget who I am.
- Coward!

00:44:58.162 --> 00:45:00.392
They do not forget.

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:02.863
Your crew sees you
for the miscreant you are.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.332
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:07.870
Twice in one day,
I find myself in a bewilderment.

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.132
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:13.139
You dare not walk the path of
righteousness, the way of the light.

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:17.542
No, sir. The truth is
it be much simpler than all that.

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:20.582
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.

00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:22.709
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:25.447
- No!
- All Latin blood like her mother.

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:27.682
Father, I beg you.

00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:31.557
There I be again,
forgetting why the missionary is here.

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:36.098
My daughter fears for my soul,
or what's left of it.

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:40.764
You truly wish to save me, my child?

00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:42.838
Every soul can be saved.

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:45.772
Be that true, young cleric?

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:49.606
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.

00:45:50.614 --> 00:45:54.573
Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul
on this hell-bound vessel.

00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:59.783
You disarm me with your faith.

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:02.625
Eight bells!

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.752
Which of you unfortunate souls
stood watch?

00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:10.856
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.639
You?

00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:19.935
Aye.

00:46:20.477 --> 00:46:22.274
Aye.

00:46:22.412 --> 00:46:24.403
The cook.

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:27.416
Perfect. Lower the longboat!

00:46:32.656 --> 00:46:34.647
Bring her about!

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:49.229
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:51.670
Our laws allow the Captain
to show leniency.

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:54.437
I have given this man
a chance to determine his fate,

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:56.240
a gift not afforded to all.

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.822
Oh, you now.

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.719
Chance to show the worth
of your prayers.

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:14.922
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.605
Course made!

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:26.606
Stop. Give that man a chance.
Give yourself a...

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:54.930
You know when I feel closest
to our Maker?

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.937
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:59.599
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:03.440
And I see it revealed when in times
of hardship and tragedy,

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.878
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:08.416
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.747
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again!

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.060
I actually have no interest
in the Fountain whatsoever,

00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:28.068
so, if your heart is set,

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:30.400
you may drop me off
anywhere you like.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.303
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:38.804
Your words surround you like fog
and make you hard to see.

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:42.783
And what of you,
the mighty Blackbeard?

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.684
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam

00:48:45.856 --> 00:48:49.292
three times around your ship,
then climbed back onboard.

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:52.020
And here you are, running scared.

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:56.099
- Scared.
- To the Fountain.

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:59.259
The Quartermaster
sees things before they happen.

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:03.897
He has foreseen my death,
and so the fates have spoken.

00:49:04.007 --> 00:49:06.373
The threads of destiny woven.

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:09.478
You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.240
- And you?
- Me?

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:15.648
I'm skeptical of predicting
any future... which includes me.

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:21.588
It'd be foolish to battle fate,
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:24.593
I will reach the Fountain.
You will lead me.

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:31.023
That knife will serve you no better
than the mutiny you devised.

00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:32.965
Mutiny served me well.

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:35.037
It gained me an audience with you.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.268
Aye.

00:49:39.676 --> 00:49:41.473
To warn you.

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:44.004
Regarding your first mate,

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:47.048
who pretends to be persons she is not.

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:48.675
Do tell.

00:49:51.254 --> 00:49:53.051
She is not your daughter.

00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:59.386
You dare to speak
thusly of my flesh and blood?

00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:04.057
Sir, the woman is consummate
in the art of deception.

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:08.661
I know. As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:10.739
Though I cannot claim credit

00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:13.843
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:18.337
Angelica.
My beloved daughter,

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:21.076
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:23.880
and you claim to be the one
who corrupted her?

00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:28.048
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:30.591
More to be feared than a wild beast.

00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:34.561
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:36.723
Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:39.028
- Father?
- Sweetness!

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:42.529
No need to hurt him, Father.

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:45.903
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:49.774
You see? Even now,
she attends to your welfare,

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:53.474
giving lie to the claims
you make of her.

00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:05.552
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:08.058
Put another way.

00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:12.266
If I do not make it
to the Fountain in time...

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:16.896
...neither will you.

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:23.172
I'll have a wee look-see at those charts
straight away then, shall I?

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:28.179
Sir.

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:33.420
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:35.957
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

00:51:36.093 --> 00:51:38.288
among the crew,
as to our destination.

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.454
Shut your trap and make way.

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:49.098
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect, sir.

00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:52.739
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:54.808
Whitecap Bay.

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:58.073
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

00:51:58.181 --> 00:52:02.277
And every worthless seaman
fears the name, and rightly so,

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:04.785
though few know why or dare to ask.

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:06.548
Be the stories true?

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:08.520
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:11.821
or forever leave it
to the wider fields of fancy.

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:16.125
Mermaids, Captain.

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:18.029
Aye. Mermaids.

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:22.332
Sea ghouls, devil fish,
dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:26.033
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:27.768
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:31.541
as mermaids be given
to take the rest...

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:33.114
...to the bone.

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:37.814
Steady! Steady, men!
Find your courage,

00:52:37.954 --> 00:52:39.854
or be ready to purpose your fear!

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.390
Save yourselves!

00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:47.828
- Man overboard!
- Nay! A deserter.

00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:49.727
- Come about.
- Nay!

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:54.835
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
any more of any man than what

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:59.465
that man can deliver, but I do ask this:
Are we not king's men?

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:01.043
Aye.

00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:03.942
- On the king's mission?
- Aye.

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:08.346
I did not note any fear in the eyes
of the Spanish as they passed us by.

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:11.215
- Are we not king's men?
- Aye!

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:14.289
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:17.392
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.395
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:36.868
Come.

00:53:37.013 --> 00:53:38.310
Little drink?

00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:41.712
Wine, music, candlelight.

00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:44.081
I think we've traveled down
this road before, Jack.

00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:46.052
Yes, we have.

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:48.422
I remember it well.

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:55.095
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.

00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:57.564
Incessant writhing.

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:59.566
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:02.562
La Martinique.

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:04.401
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:06.304
Either or.

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.135
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:12.737
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:17.114
You can be so charming
when you want something, Jack.

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:19.745
The trick is finding out what.

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:22.950
The truth, then, is it?

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.151
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:28.628
You and I can go to
the Fountain together,

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:31.825
where we shall bathe one another
in equal shares of fame

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:33.993
and other assorted debaucheries.

00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:37.129
And I'll tell you
the ritual of the Fountain.

00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:40.107
Yes. The profane ritual.

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:45.007
Can I trust you, Jack?

00:54:45.148 --> 00:54:49.585
- I need you on my side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:53.144
You and I are as
thick as thieves, love.

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:55.520
Tell me the rules.

00:54:57.661 --> 00:55:01.324
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:06.602
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:10.036
The silver chalices of Ponce de León.

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.704
With these items...

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:15.970
- Yes?
- With these items,

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:19.513
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.616
You know what that means.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.655
We cannot go alone, you and I.

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:29.054
The ritual requires a victim.

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:34.662
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:38.532
I find my desire for the Fountain
greatly lessened.

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:42.564
But there is something onboard
you do want.

00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:49.710
What about Blackbeard?

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:53.441
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.

00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:05.119
He keeps each ship as a prize.

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:11.356
You help me,
and I promise you your pick.

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:14.902
Though I think I know the one
you will choose.

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:23.268
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:25.142
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.787
He's even more annoying in miniature.

00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:37.950
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.

00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:40.961
You are not going to steal the life
of some innocent man.

00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:43.829
What about the one-legged man?

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.730
I need years, Jack.

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:52.975
Not for me. For my father.

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:57.910
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:01.110
You've fallen for your own con, love.

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:03.515
No, he is my father.

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:05.381
The lies I told you were not lies.

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:10.058
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.185
- Yes.
- That's very good.

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.796
- May I use that?
- I'm sure you will, anyway.

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:17.297
Of course I will.

00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:20.130
So, will you not give up this quest?

00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:23.865
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:28.407
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.311
...he is evil,

00:57:31.448 --> 00:57:33.643
and he will kill you given the chance.

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:36.877
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:39.214
the limits on redemption?

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:42.688
You stole years of my life, Jack.
You owe me.

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:45.886
And you are en route
to getting yourself killed,

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:48.360
and I am not inclined
to stand by and watch.

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:52.229
Whitecap Bay!

00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.832
All hands on deck!
Set to the longboats!

00:58:04.814 --> 00:58:05.838
Lay 'em out flat!

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:11.317
No tangles. Make 'em look
pretty for our dainty guests.

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:15.254
We're gonna need light.
A lot of light.

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:18.050
Come!

00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:45.082
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like a miracle from God.

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:48.952
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the English.

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:50.217
Let's not get our hopes up.

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:03.205
The old moon in
the arms of the new one.

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:04.567
First of the summer.

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:08.706
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:24.893
We're doomed.
They be drawn to man-made light.

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:27.724
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.

00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:30.389
There'll be mermaids upon us
within the hour,

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:33.991
you mark my words.
And we're the bait.

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:42.304
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
protects a sailor from drowning.

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:46.313
Don't be a fool!
Mermaids are all female, son,

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:49.247
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:53.651
But when it comes time
to churn butter, so to speak,

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:55.781
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:58.951
or off the deck of a ship,
have their way,

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:04.032
and then the sailors are pulled
to bottom and drowned and eaten.

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:07.925
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.832
- Sing.
- What?

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:15.336
They like to hear singing.

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:23.277
My name is Maria

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:26.582
A merchant's daughter fair

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:30.318
- Louder.
- And I have left my parents

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.657
And 3,000 pounds a year

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:36.822
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:40.402
I disdain all glittering gold

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:44.028
There is nothing can console me

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:47.074
But my jolly sailor bold

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.804
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:56.646
I disdain all glittering gold

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:59.516
There is nothing can console me

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:04.150
But my jolly sailor bold

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.569
Lord save me.

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:30.308
Man, look. Look there.

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.246
You'll scare her off!

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:33.912
Aye, and good riddance!

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:40.590
Can you talk?

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.795
Yes.

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:53.809
You're beautiful.

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:58.410
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:03.751
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:08.215
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself!

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.549
Boys! There ain't much
been given to me

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:14.094
in my brief, miserable life,
there's the truth in it.

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.959
But, by God, I'll have it said

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:19.500
that Scrum had himself a kiss
from a proper mermaid!

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:24.402
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:28.067
I disdain all glittering gold

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:31.612
There is nothing can console me

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.844
But my jolly sailor bold

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:40.845
Come all ye pretty fair maids

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:45.252
Whoever you may be

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:48.955
Who love a jolly sailor bold

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:53.831
That ploughs the raging sea

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:58.100
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:02.439
I disdain all glittering gold

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:06.776
There is nothing can console me

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:11.285
But my jolly sailor bold

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:16.551
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:19.957
I disdain all glittering gold

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:24.157
There is nothing can console me

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.134
But my jolly sailor bold

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.266
Out upon it! It has begun!

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:51.051
Light 'em up!

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:55.749
Muster your courage!
Drive 'em to shore!

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:09.638
Nets into the water! Quickly!

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:02.522
Retreat, all, to land!
For your lives!

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.294
Retreat, I say!

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:09.455
Cowards! Back in the water!

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:13.796
There be no refuge on land! On my word!

01:06:47.015 --> 01:06:48.050
Come on!

01:08:23.256 --> 01:08:25.417
We got one!

01:08:29.696 --> 01:08:31.061
I'm in love!

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.233
Check the wounded!

01:08:35.368 --> 01:08:38.166
See if you can find
one mermaid still alive!

01:09:17.443 --> 01:09:18.603
Come, give a hand!

01:09:19.846 --> 01:09:21.871
Well done, sailor.

01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:24.477
Did everyone see that?

01:09:24.651 --> 01:09:26.676
Because I will not be doing it again.

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:31.486
Back to the ship.
We head for a protected cove. Now.

01:09:48.342 --> 01:09:51.277
- Lord. Is that?
- Mermaid.

01:09:51.412 --> 01:09:54.939
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.

01:09:55.816 --> 01:09:56.840
Ever walk on the beach,

01:09:57.017 --> 01:09:59.281
look back and see your footsteps
in the sand?

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:03.413
It's like that,
except the footsteps lie before me.

01:10:03.557 --> 01:10:07.391
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay, sir.

01:10:07.494 --> 01:10:09.121
We must hasten.

01:10:17.271 --> 01:10:20.798
We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a heading.

01:10:20.941 --> 01:10:24.104
- But, sir, the men.
- They be dead already.

01:10:24.244 --> 01:10:27.338
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?

01:10:27.481 --> 01:10:31.815
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.

01:10:31.952 --> 01:10:34.011
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:40.487
Seagulls... nesting.

01:10:40.627 --> 01:10:43.687
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?

01:10:52.339 --> 01:10:53.897
My God.

01:10:54.074 --> 01:10:56.099
Your head or my heading.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.440
I'll have me one or t'other,
I don't care which.

01:11:03.617 --> 01:11:05.881
All hands, forward!

01:11:21.336 --> 01:11:25.830
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?

01:11:25.974 --> 01:11:28.602
Best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.

01:11:28.776 --> 01:11:33.475
- I be a cautious man.
- So be I.

01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:35.344
What I want first...

01:11:38.887 --> 01:11:40.946
...is Ponce De León's ship.

01:12:18.059 --> 01:12:19.890
Why is it we've got to bring her along?

01:12:20.028 --> 01:12:23.259
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.

01:12:23.398 --> 01:12:26.128
What is the ritual again?

01:12:26.267 --> 01:12:28.735
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:30.394
And two silver chalices.

01:12:30.538 --> 01:12:33.200
One cup with a tear, one without.

01:12:34.442 --> 01:12:36.876
So, one with a tear and water in both?

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:38.536
Quite complicated, is it not?

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:41.740
Both get water. One gets a tear.

01:12:41.883 --> 01:12:44.545
The person who drinks
the water with the tear

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:47.143
gets all the years of life
from the other.

01:12:48.323 --> 01:12:50.416
How many years?

01:12:51.859 --> 01:12:54.828
All the years
that they have lived,

01:12:54.963 --> 01:12:58.490
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.

01:13:07.809 --> 01:13:09.106
Clergyman.

01:13:11.079 --> 01:13:14.014
On the off chance that this
does not go well for me,

01:13:14.148 --> 01:13:15.706
I would like it noted here and now

01:13:15.883 --> 01:13:19.114
that I am fully prepared
to believe in whatever I must,

01:13:19.254 --> 01:13:21.017
so that I may be
welcomed into that place

01:13:21.156 --> 01:13:23.590
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?

01:13:23.692 --> 01:13:27.355
We have a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.

01:13:27.496 --> 01:13:29.987
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

01:13:33.969 --> 01:13:35.266
Quartermaster!

01:13:35.838 --> 01:13:37.601
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe!

01:13:37.706 --> 01:13:40.800
- She has water.
- She needs air!

01:13:44.713 --> 01:13:46.681
- Open this.
- She will escape.

01:13:46.815 --> 01:13:50.546
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.

01:13:59.061 --> 01:14:00.153
See?

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.895
Onward.

01:14:31.093 --> 01:14:34.551
Just as I thought. Not this way!

01:14:36.632 --> 01:14:38.065
This is the way, isn't it?

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.033
'Course it is, but we
should go around to the east.

01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:43.035
That would take us out of
the path of the chalices.

01:14:43.172 --> 01:14:44.935
- Well, then we'll circle back.
- There is no time.

01:14:45.074 --> 01:14:46.735
You're the one who insisted
on bringing the bloody mermaid.

01:14:46.875 --> 01:14:48.866
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.

01:14:49.011 --> 01:14:51.104
- You would know.
- Someone must go.

01:14:52.181 --> 01:14:53.705
You mean split up?

01:14:53.849 --> 01:14:56.750
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.

01:14:56.885 --> 01:15:00.878
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

01:15:01.056 --> 01:15:03.024
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?

01:15:03.125 --> 01:15:06.390
Yes, what makes you think
he will come back?

01:15:06.528 --> 01:15:09.019
We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.

01:15:09.865 --> 01:15:11.594
She'll go.

01:15:15.604 --> 01:15:16.969
How much farther to the Fountain?

01:15:17.107 --> 01:15:18.802
I'm running out of time.

01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:22.938
About a day's march north,
following that river,

01:15:23.079 --> 01:15:26.571
you'll get to a series of pools.
Then you're close.

01:15:29.052 --> 01:15:30.314
You will go.

01:15:33.223 --> 01:15:35.521
I was sure it would come to this.

01:15:49.105 --> 01:15:53.269
You know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?

01:15:53.409 --> 01:15:55.343
Sudden urge to jump?

01:15:57.247 --> 01:15:58.805
I don't have it.

01:16:00.183 --> 01:16:01.741
I need those chalices.

01:16:01.851 --> 01:16:04.342
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

01:16:04.487 --> 01:16:07.547
You will go. You will return...

01:16:08.858 --> 01:16:10.849
...or I will kill her.

01:16:13.663 --> 01:16:15.187
You won't kill your own daughter.

01:16:15.331 --> 01:16:18.129
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

01:16:18.268 --> 01:16:19.860
remove the shot from all but two,

01:16:20.003 --> 01:16:22.494
but do not tell me which two.

01:16:24.774 --> 01:16:27.368
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

01:16:30.146 --> 01:16:31.340
No.

01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:34.574
No.

01:16:37.687 --> 01:16:40.520
- Yes.
- You're sure?

01:16:40.657 --> 01:16:42.124
'Course I am.

01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:51.391
Again.

01:16:52.902 --> 01:16:55.462
Please, they're not even loaded.

01:17:00.376 --> 01:17:01.673
Again.

01:17:02.512 --> 01:17:04.412
If you're so keen on killing her,

01:17:04.547 --> 01:17:06.947
- why don't you just let her jump?
- What?

01:17:07.717 --> 01:17:10.208
If you jump and die,

01:17:10.353 --> 01:17:14.016
then she will have her chance.

01:17:14.157 --> 01:17:15.624
Again.

01:17:18.863 --> 01:17:20.763
Oi...

01:17:20.898 --> 01:17:24.766
...if I jump, will I survive?

01:17:27.071 --> 01:17:28.436
The doll.

01:17:44.755 --> 01:17:49.522
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense! I'm going!

01:18:08.245 --> 01:18:11.476
Wet. Wet again.

01:18:13.784 --> 01:18:16.685
We go on.
Due north to the Fountain.

01:18:17.521 --> 01:18:18.886
Well played, Father.

01:18:20.624 --> 01:18:22.956
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

01:18:25.663 --> 01:18:27.654
Of course, my love.

01:18:37.308 --> 01:18:40.038
Be nice to have a map about now.

01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:41.837
Or a ship.

01:18:42.579 --> 01:18:46.310
Stop! Hold very still.

01:18:47.751 --> 01:18:51.278
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

01:18:59.997 --> 01:19:03.262
What? What be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?

01:19:03.367 --> 01:19:05.927
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

01:19:06.036 --> 01:19:08.266
- Push on!
- You can sleep when you're dead.

01:19:08.372 --> 01:19:09.600
Push on!

01:19:11.175 --> 01:19:14.542
Fortune continues to favor us.

01:19:42.307 --> 01:19:44.537
The Santiago.

01:19:44.676 --> 01:19:47.406
Famously captained by Ponce de León.

01:19:50.181 --> 01:19:51.648
There's no one there.

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:52.774
Right, then.

01:20:27.452 --> 01:20:28.885
We must not stop.

01:20:36.895 --> 01:20:38.692
You will walk.

01:20:57.816 --> 01:20:59.977
I cannot.

01:21:00.118 --> 01:21:01.915
Walk or die.

01:21:08.359 --> 01:21:09.587
Put your arms around me.

01:21:09.727 --> 01:21:13.128
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.

01:21:30.049 --> 01:21:34.349
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.

01:21:53.672 --> 01:21:55.435
Hold here 'til I say!

01:22:08.487 --> 01:22:10.352
Such beauty.

01:22:10.489 --> 01:22:13.822
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

01:22:13.959 --> 01:22:16.894
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

01:22:17.029 --> 01:22:19.327
who found no refuge on the Ark.

01:22:22.101 --> 01:22:24.228
Such beauty...

01:22:25.504 --> 01:22:27.131
...and yet deadly.

01:22:28.107 --> 01:22:31.565
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.

01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:36.670
No. You are different.

01:22:37.583 --> 01:22:38.811
Different?

01:22:38.918 --> 01:22:42.945
Are you not? You protect.

01:22:46.358 --> 01:22:47.416
Did you?

01:22:49.061 --> 01:22:51.859
You pushed me down out of the way.

01:22:52.998 --> 01:22:57.492
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.

01:22:58.037 --> 01:22:59.902
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.

01:23:00.039 --> 01:23:02.030
She has a name!

01:23:06.545 --> 01:23:08.069
Pray tell.

01:23:14.287 --> 01:23:16.187
She is Syrena.

01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:58.654
Ponce de León.

01:24:02.335 --> 01:24:06.032
If 40 pirates
dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

01:24:06.206 --> 01:24:09.767
it would not match
the contents of this room.

01:24:09.909 --> 01:24:11.467
You.

01:24:14.247 --> 01:24:16.044
- You.
- No...

01:24:17.217 --> 01:24:19.481
...you.
- I was here first.

01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:23.646
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.

01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:26.281
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices

01:24:26.426 --> 01:24:29.793
- for my royal liege.
- Oh, please.

01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:32.828
Back, back! We have to balance it out!

01:24:34.801 --> 01:24:37.395
The whole ship will slide!

01:24:41.174 --> 01:24:42.801
Right, then.

01:24:42.942 --> 01:24:48.881
What if we each choose an item
of approximately equal weight?

01:24:51.518 --> 01:24:52.985
Put it back!

01:24:54.487 --> 01:24:56.546
We touch nothing!

01:25:04.464 --> 01:25:05.431
What about that?

01:25:05.598 --> 01:25:07.964
The chalices.

01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:11.194
Oi! Why do you get to look first?

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:13.034
Fine, then.

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:33.851
- Together.
- Together.

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:37.588
Rocks.

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.031
The Spanish.

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:42.430
They're ahead of us, mate.

01:25:43.337 --> 01:25:46.602
I shall have a look at that map.
If it's what I fear...

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:58.914
I wonder why they left this behind.

01:26:01.889 --> 01:26:05.689
Don't touch the map.

01:26:11.031 --> 01:26:12.123
They know the path,

01:26:12.266 --> 01:26:16.168
but I can also see where
they'll most likely make camp.

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:30.948
Jack!

01:26:34.121 --> 01:26:38.285
Gibbs, I was just on me way
to break you out of jail.

01:26:40.227 --> 01:26:41.751
You stole my map.

01:26:42.296 --> 01:26:44.764
Right. Best be started.

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:49.326
OlE

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.211
Mermaids.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.994
Careful, these pools run deep.

01:27:14.129 --> 01:27:17.690
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:22.633
Look. Look!

01:27:24.206 --> 01:27:27.175
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

01:27:27.309 --> 01:27:30.904
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:35.243
but just enough to make the dying slow.

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:37.475
Think on it.

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:41.020
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

01:27:41.156 --> 01:27:45.490
Syrena, won't you cry?

01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:48.192
All die, even you.

01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:51.788
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:55.700
Listen.

01:27:55.837 --> 01:27:59.170
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:01.741
Do you not hear them?

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:05.575
We need but one tear.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:09.747
Vile creature!

01:28:09.885 --> 01:28:12.479
- Chop off her fingers, one by one!
- Choke her!

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:15.215
Cut out the tears
from behind the eyes!

01:28:15.357 --> 01:28:16.688
Where's your voice in this?

01:28:17.559 --> 01:28:20.585
Maybe she'll have a change of heart
when the sun rises.

01:28:20.729 --> 01:28:24.631
Oh, aye, she will burn,
but I cannot wait for the sun.

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.494
Perhaps we should build a fire.

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:28.762
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:31.964
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.268
I will tear every scale
from her body one by one if I see fit.

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:36.968
If that displeases you, go pray.

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:40.239
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.

01:28:40.382 --> 01:28:43.249
Behold, gentlemen,
a man formerly of faith.

01:28:43.385 --> 01:28:46.286
That vile creature, as you call her,
is worth a hundred of you.

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:48.184
Oh, you care for her?

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:52.216
You fancy her.

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:56.625
And do not deny what is
clear to my eyes.

01:28:58.433 --> 01:28:59.559
Question is...

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.728
...does she fancy you?

01:29:06.976 --> 01:29:10.571
By God, she does. We are in luck!

01:29:11.981 --> 01:29:13.881
Bring forth a tear...

01:29:15.384 --> 01:29:17.909
...or witness the death
of this poor soul.

01:29:20.056 --> 01:29:23.492
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

01:29:23.626 --> 01:29:25.218
I would be grateful.

01:29:26.562 --> 01:29:28.154
Sadness, yes,

01:29:28.297 --> 01:29:33.701
- but no sorrow... yet.
- Not by your hand, Father!

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:36.497
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.

01:29:48.818 --> 01:29:52.310
Aye, mermaids are tough.

01:29:52.455 --> 01:29:54.480
The lot of them.

01:29:54.624 --> 01:29:59.027
Tie her up like the others.
And get rid of this.

01:30:03.599 --> 01:30:06.591
- You are confident?
- Yes.

01:30:06.702 --> 01:30:09.694
I am a woman. So is she.

01:30:17.713 --> 01:30:20.739
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.

01:30:21.817 --> 01:30:23.614
There is a girl...

01:30:23.719 --> 01:30:26.950
...a female... of the opposite sex.

01:30:27.056 --> 01:30:31.015
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel."

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.186
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:37.561
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:41.295
- some manner of harm many moons ago.
- Out with it.

01:30:41.404 --> 01:30:44.737
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

01:30:44.874 --> 01:30:48.776
Ah, you pretended to love her,
then you left her and broke her heart.

01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:53.643
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...

01:30:55.818 --> 01:30:58.981
...stirrings.
- Stirrings?

01:30:59.088 --> 01:31:03.081
- Stirrings.
- What? Like feelings, you mean?

01:31:03.226 --> 01:31:06.252
No, no, no. Not quite all the way
to feelings. More like...

01:31:10.367 --> 01:31:11.994
All right, feelings, damn you.

01:31:12.102 --> 01:31:16.801
And you left her still.
That's low.

01:31:18.241 --> 01:31:19.469
Thank you.

01:31:26.383 --> 01:31:27.816
Stealth over force.

01:31:27.984 --> 01:31:31.715
I'll take it from here
on account of your condition.

01:31:32.856 --> 01:31:34.721
You don't have termites, do you?

01:31:34.858 --> 01:31:36.826
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

01:31:36.993 --> 01:31:39.484
but I'll be keeping
you company all the same.

01:31:39.663 --> 01:31:42.723
Hold here, Lieutenant Commander.
Wait for my signal.

01:32:14.698 --> 01:32:16.791
There. That one.
That be the leader.

01:32:16.933 --> 01:32:19.424
Make note of his tent
because that's where...

01:32:20.904 --> 01:32:25.136
No, wait. By God,
that must be them right there.

01:32:28.645 --> 01:32:30.875
Your sword smells funny.

01:32:31.047 --> 01:32:35.950
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

01:32:36.086 --> 01:32:39.180
Just a scratch,
you're a dead man in minutes.

01:32:39.322 --> 01:32:41.654
Would you mind pointing it
the other way?

01:32:41.792 --> 01:32:43.555
I don't like toads.

01:32:48.431 --> 01:32:51.867
- What are you doing?
- Planning an escape route.

01:32:52.002 --> 01:32:56.098
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.

01:32:56.206 --> 01:32:59.334
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

01:33:26.337 --> 01:33:27.827
Now what?

01:33:28.706 --> 01:33:31.231
We stroll out, slow and steady.

01:33:31.375 --> 01:33:33.206
Just like we belong.

01:34:32.637 --> 01:34:36.903
- I'm sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.

01:34:37.041 --> 01:34:41.239
- Yes.
- You came for me.

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.604
Why?

01:34:46.717 --> 01:34:49.015
You're different, are you not?

01:34:51.222 --> 01:34:55.591
Do you know not of kindness?
Compassion?

01:35:12.778 --> 01:35:14.769
Tears of sorrow, never.

01:35:14.913 --> 01:35:17.347
Mermaids be too tough for that.

01:35:17.482 --> 01:35:19.643
But tears of joy...

01:35:21.153 --> 01:35:23.587
They say these be
the more potent anyway.

01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:26.681
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.393
Let her go.
You don't need her now.

01:35:29.561 --> 01:35:32.496
Let her go? No.

01:35:32.631 --> 01:35:35.623
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.

01:35:45.177 --> 01:35:47.168
How's that escape route working?

01:35:47.312 --> 01:35:50.281
Here's your chance to improvise.

01:35:50.382 --> 01:35:51.713
I'm attempting it.

01:35:51.850 --> 01:35:54.683
I might be able to get a hand loose.

01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:57.084
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.

01:35:58.190 --> 01:35:59.714
Better.

01:36:05.163 --> 01:36:06.425
I want one of those.

01:36:11.136 --> 01:36:15.368
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

01:36:15.507 --> 01:36:19.967
- Revenge?
- Come, come, Hector.

01:36:20.078 --> 01:36:21.511
If you wanted the chalices,

01:36:21.646 --> 01:36:24.342
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

01:36:24.483 --> 01:36:27.646
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

01:36:29.621 --> 01:36:32.852
King George. Privateer. Wig.

01:36:33.992 --> 01:36:35.425
Cheap theatrical facade.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:38.427
- I'm not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.

01:36:38.563 --> 01:36:42.397
- When the Pearl was lost?
- Taken, not lost.

01:36:45.003 --> 01:36:49.133
We were off the coast of Hispaniola
when we came under attack.

01:36:49.307 --> 01:36:52.743
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

01:36:52.878 --> 01:36:55.540
We were peppered with cannon fire.

01:36:56.682 --> 01:36:59.913
And then the sea beneath
the Pearl began to roil.

01:37:01.454 --> 01:37:03.888
The Pearl was pitching
and yawing violently.

01:37:04.023 --> 01:37:05.888
Every plank, every rail,

01:37:06.025 --> 01:37:08.892
every spar, all at once,
began to creak.

01:37:09.028 --> 01:37:12.054
The rigging had come to life.

01:37:12.198 --> 01:37:14.894
Our own ship turned against us...

01:37:15.034 --> 01:37:18.299
...tangling the crew,
wrapping around 'em like snakes.

01:37:18.438 --> 01:37:20.838
And wrapping around me leg.

01:37:21.007 --> 01:37:23.407
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

01:37:23.543 --> 01:37:27.070
I am the master of me ship,
not Blackbeard.

01:37:27.213 --> 01:37:30.705
I am the master of my fate,
not Blackbeard.

01:37:31.717 --> 01:37:34.083
So I did what needed done.

01:37:40.927 --> 01:37:42.861
I survived.

01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:48.628
So... you're not after the Fountain.

01:37:48.768 --> 01:37:52.431
I care not for King George
or tavern yarns

01:37:52.572 --> 01:37:54.802
that give hope for a healed limb.

01:37:56.442 --> 01:38:00.105
But I'd give my left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.

01:38:00.313 --> 01:38:03.282
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm

01:38:03.416 --> 01:38:08.080
to drive my poisoned blade
through his heart.

01:38:09.055 --> 01:38:11.489
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

01:39:30.237 --> 01:39:31.568
The prisoner's escaping.

01:39:38.845 --> 01:39:41.541
He's escaping!
Fan out! Find him!

01:39:41.682 --> 01:39:42.774
Go! Go!

01:39:44.851 --> 01:39:47.718
Hold your fire! I want him alive!

01:39:55.929 --> 01:39:57.897
I figured that was the signal.

01:40:40.974 --> 01:40:44.466
- Go! Prepare to move out!
- The enemy is soon upon us.

01:40:46.213 --> 01:40:49.148
I'm sorry about the chalices, Jack,
but I've an appointment to keep.

01:40:49.283 --> 01:40:52.275
- I'll not be going back.
- No need.

01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:55.446
- Shall we have a drink?
- We'll drink at the Fountain.

01:41:13.808 --> 01:41:17.369
How is it we can never meet
without you pointing something at me?

01:41:18.579 --> 01:41:20.479
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

01:41:20.615 --> 01:41:23.209
Aye. Oi!

01:41:26.688 --> 01:41:29.816
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.

01:41:29.957 --> 01:41:33.188
And the one-legged man, he is near.
Aye?

01:41:33.328 --> 01:41:34.727
Aye.

01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:36.554
Now...

01:41:36.698 --> 01:41:39.531
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.

01:41:39.667 --> 01:41:41.726
- Name them.
- Firstly,

01:41:41.869 --> 01:41:44.235
I'll be having me compass back.
No, no, that's secondly.

01:41:44.372 --> 01:41:46.636
Firstly, upon your word,

01:41:46.741 --> 01:41:48.732
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

01:41:48.876 --> 01:41:51.242
I'll make no vows
to the likes of you, Sparrow.

01:41:51.379 --> 01:41:53.847
But it costs me nothing to admit

01:41:53.981 --> 01:41:56.848
that she was never in harm's way.

01:41:57.485 --> 01:41:59.680
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

01:41:59.821 --> 01:42:01.448
I will be having me compass back.

01:42:02.357 --> 01:42:04.382
Please? I do deserve it.

01:42:04.525 --> 01:42:08.017
Do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch that filthy pig?

01:42:08.162 --> 01:42:10.528
Not the big one,
the four-legged one.

01:42:13.968 --> 01:42:17.734
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

01:42:17.872 --> 01:42:20.568
there are times, not very often,

01:42:20.708 --> 01:42:23.802
when I do reflect
upon my heinous misdeeds.

01:42:23.978 --> 01:42:28.244
Chief among them, I note how poorly
I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

01:42:28.383 --> 01:42:31.045
- my loyal first mate.
- Aye! Now you bring it up...

01:42:31.185 --> 01:42:33.881
Left him to rot in jail, I did.
Didn't care.

01:42:34.021 --> 01:42:38.685
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.

01:42:40.528 --> 01:42:43.895
- Is that it?
- I think so.

01:42:44.031 --> 01:42:46.625
Quick, or the pig runs,
and good luck getting those chalices.

01:42:46.768 --> 01:42:48.235
Jack, if it's all the same to you,
I'd be just as...

01:42:48.369 --> 01:42:49.700
Done.

01:42:49.805 --> 01:42:51.033
Release the swine.

01:42:56.812 --> 01:43:00.077
Perhaps, if you don't mind,
I could tag along with you folk for a...

01:43:02.818 --> 01:43:05.082
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:14.627
I could have swore it was
somewhere right around here.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:47.086
We must not stop.

01:45:04.407 --> 01:45:05.840
Dead end.

01:45:06.843 --> 01:45:08.777
Dead. End.

01:45:09.479 --> 01:45:10.878
Dead end.

01:45:11.915 --> 01:45:14.884
Jack, I'm starting to think
you don't know where you're going.

01:45:15.685 --> 01:45:18.518
It is not the destination
so much as the journey, they say.

01:45:19.722 --> 01:45:21.189
Chalices, if you please.

01:45:33.202 --> 01:45:34.726
Stand back.

01:45:57.093 --> 01:45:58.651
Jack...

01:45:58.795 --> 01:46:00.729
...have you ever, in fact...

01:46:00.863 --> 01:46:06.358
...seen with your own eyes...
the Fountain of Youth?

01:46:06.536 --> 01:46:08.697
I'm sorry, could you
repeat the question, please?

01:46:08.871 --> 01:46:10.338
Quartermaster.

01:46:11.274 --> 01:46:12.241
No, no!

01:46:15.912 --> 01:46:18.039
Wait, wait! Wait.

01:46:21.317 --> 01:46:25.777
"Aqua... de Vida."

01:47:05.129 --> 01:47:07.654
Master Scrum...

01:47:07.798 --> 01:47:10.665
...do you mind?
- Squire?

01:48:09.359 --> 01:48:11.350
So beautiful.

01:48:50.835 --> 01:48:53.463
Sparrow, I'll be the first
to taste those waters.

01:48:57.942 --> 01:48:59.534
Father.

01:49:02.814 --> 01:49:05.112
The one-legged man.

01:49:07.652 --> 01:49:11.611
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?

01:49:11.756 --> 01:49:13.849
Edward Teach!

01:49:13.992 --> 01:49:17.291
For crimes committed on the high seas,

01:49:17.428 --> 01:49:21.296
by the authority granted me
by His Majesty the King...

01:49:21.432 --> 01:49:24.629
...and with a goodly amount
of personal satisfaction...

01:49:24.769 --> 01:49:27.829
...I hereby place you
in the custody of the court,

01:49:27.972 --> 01:49:31.305
and declare you to be my prisoner.

01:49:32.343 --> 01:49:35.870
My trick's out, is that it?

01:49:36.014 --> 01:49:40.451
Such crimes do include, but are not
limited to, piracy, treason,

01:49:40.552 --> 01:49:44.716
murder, torture of
the most heinous sort,

01:49:44.856 --> 01:49:48.792
including the brutal theft of one used,
twisted, hairy right leg.

01:49:49.561 --> 01:49:54.260
You... dare face this sword?

01:49:54.432 --> 01:49:56.866
This far away from your ship? Aye.

01:49:57.001 --> 01:50:01.734
Aye. That be the cold breath
of fate I feel down my nape.

01:50:01.873 --> 01:50:07.539
But I'll have one last fight, by God.

01:50:07.679 --> 01:50:09.408
Kill 'em all!

01:50:11.049 --> 01:50:12.846
Hang on a minute.

01:50:12.984 --> 01:50:16.886
I just... I just need
to understand something.

01:50:17.021 --> 01:50:20.388
Right, so, you will fight against them,

01:50:20.525 --> 01:50:21.856
they will fight against you.

01:50:21.993 --> 01:50:25.690
All on account of him
wanting to kill him?

01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:29.766
Where is the sense? Exactly.

01:50:29.901 --> 01:50:33.632
I say, let them fight
each other while we lay back,

01:50:33.805 --> 01:50:37.241
watch, have a drink,
place some wagers!

01:50:38.343 --> 01:50:39.640
Aye.

01:50:42.214 --> 01:50:43.841
- Kill 'em!
- No quarter!

01:51:14.313 --> 01:51:15.974
Get off me!

01:51:48.948 --> 01:51:49.972
Scrum, the chalices!

01:51:52.117 --> 01:51:53.243
And the tear! Follow!

01:51:57.256 --> 01:51:58.450
Fight!

01:51:59.358 --> 01:52:02.919
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.

01:52:03.028 --> 01:52:05.360
I'm more afraid of her
than I am of you.

01:52:10.903 --> 01:52:13.303
Hand it over.
There's a good lad.

01:52:16.675 --> 01:52:20.406
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.

01:52:20.579 --> 01:52:24.811
I told you, I need years.
And now, yours will do.

01:52:32.725 --> 01:52:33.953
Scrum!

01:52:55.615 --> 01:52:57.082
Syrena...

01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:03.584
Oh God, you will not take her.

01:53:03.723 --> 01:53:08.683
If you have taken her,
you will give her back.

01:53:08.828 --> 01:53:11.194
Give her back...

01:53:11.331 --> 01:53:14.198
Give her back, please. Please.

01:53:37.791 --> 01:53:40.555
I expected fate
to put up more of a fight, eh?

01:53:57.410 --> 01:54:01.210
I will not have that smile
on your face as I strike you down.

01:54:02.615 --> 01:54:05.709
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

01:54:36.249 --> 01:54:39.548
This land is hereby forever
claimed in the glorious name

01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:42.280
of His Majesty King George...

01:54:48.529 --> 01:54:51.464
Someone make a note
of that man's bravery.

01:54:58.439 --> 01:55:02.170
Señorita, the chalices, por favor.

01:55:18.859 --> 01:55:24.525
Only God can grant eternal life,
not this pagan water.

01:55:35.576 --> 01:55:39.068
Men, destroy this profane temple!

01:55:41.815 --> 01:55:43.146
The Fountain!

01:55:57.198 --> 01:55:58.722
You are a fool.

01:55:58.866 --> 01:56:02.165
You seek in this place
what only faith can provide.

01:56:02.269 --> 01:56:04.829
Faith? In faith,
there is light enough to see

01:56:04.939 --> 01:56:07.203
but darkness enough to blind.

01:56:10.811 --> 01:56:13.075
What devilry is this?

01:56:17.051 --> 01:56:19.645
- For the Pearl.
- What have you done?

01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:25.590
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

01:56:30.231 --> 01:56:32.563
I'm not such the fool
to take on Blackbeard

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:36.101
without a little venomous advantage.

01:56:37.405 --> 01:56:38.895
Jack!

01:56:50.719 --> 01:56:52.778
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:56.357
and this sword,
payment for my missing limb!

01:57:10.772 --> 01:57:12.171
Hang on! Pull!

01:57:57.452 --> 01:57:59.818
Do not waste my tear.

01:58:29.284 --> 01:58:31.411
Drink this.
This one has the tear.

01:58:31.553 --> 01:58:33.544
- You must drink the other.
- No!

01:58:34.323 --> 01:58:37.554
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.

01:58:38.494 --> 01:58:41.588
You take it, Father, for your soul.

01:58:43.632 --> 01:58:49.070
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.

01:58:50.239 --> 01:58:53.037
This one takes life?

01:58:53.175 --> 01:58:55.040
This one has the tear and gives life?

01:58:55.177 --> 01:58:56.439
Aye, hurry!

01:59:05.354 --> 01:59:09.620
Angelica...
Save me, my child.

01:59:11.527 --> 01:59:12.960
No.

01:59:21.670 --> 01:59:23.103
I love you, Father.

01:59:36.085 --> 01:59:37.712
Wait a minute.

01:59:39.889 --> 01:59:42.722
In fact, it might have been
the other way around.

01:59:43.559 --> 01:59:47.393
This cup had the tear,
that one had the other bit.

01:59:47.496 --> 01:59:48.758
Trickster!

01:59:48.898 --> 01:59:50.763
- Devil!
- Father!

01:59:57.773 --> 01:59:59.297
You bastard! How could you?

02:00:00.309 --> 02:00:01.776
Your father saved you.

02:00:01.911 --> 02:00:04.436
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

02:01:05.242 --> 02:01:07.369
You are hurt.

02:01:09.579 --> 02:01:11.513
In body only.

02:01:13.183 --> 02:01:17.415
My mind is at peace...
because of you.

02:01:18.488 --> 02:01:21.355
- Me?
- Yes.

02:01:22.359 --> 02:01:24.759
I was lost.

02:01:25.729 --> 02:01:30.393
The wind, the tides...

02:01:30.534 --> 02:01:33.594
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

02:01:35.171 --> 02:01:37.105
But for me, only you.

02:01:38.008 --> 02:01:41.739
Philip, I can save you.

02:01:41.878 --> 02:01:44.847
You need only ask.

02:01:46.283 --> 02:01:51.084
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?

02:01:52.088 --> 02:01:54.454
Forgiveness.

02:01:54.591 --> 02:01:57.924
If not for me, you would
never have been captured.

02:01:58.061 --> 02:01:59.722
Ask.

02:02:01.598 --> 02:02:03.429
Forgive me?

02:02:28.558 --> 02:02:29.786
I hate you.

02:02:29.926 --> 02:02:32.258
The bloke who saved your life?

02:02:32.396 --> 02:02:35.593
The years I possess,
stolen from my own father!

02:02:35.733 --> 02:02:38.759
I only helped Blackbeard do what
any father should have done.

02:02:38.903 --> 02:02:42.100
You are cruel and ignorant.

02:02:45.810 --> 02:02:49.610
One pistol, one shot.

02:02:49.747 --> 02:02:51.977
To kill myself before I starve?

02:02:52.116 --> 02:02:53.674
There's no trusting you, love.

02:02:53.818 --> 02:02:56.286
Besides, this is a
well-traveled trade route.

02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:58.012
You can signal a passing ship.

02:02:58.155 --> 02:03:01.613
Or you can just bite the
proverbial bullet, as it were.

02:03:01.759 --> 02:03:03.351
And how will I get free
of these bonds?

02:03:03.494 --> 02:03:06.258
You broke free of your bonds
half an hour ago,

02:03:06.364 --> 02:03:09.197
waiting for the precise moment
to pounce.

02:03:11.902 --> 02:03:13.597
Admit it, Jack.

02:03:13.704 --> 02:03:17.640
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,

02:03:17.775 --> 02:03:20.073
I'd choose the dog.

02:03:20.244 --> 02:03:23.611
Treasure!
There is a chest with jewels!

02:03:23.714 --> 02:03:25.978
Jewels with the power
to rule the wind and tide!

02:03:26.117 --> 02:03:29.211
- You're making that up!
- Wait...

02:03:30.021 --> 02:03:33.718
I am with child. Yours.

02:03:34.959 --> 02:03:36.358
I don't recall that we ever had...

02:03:36.494 --> 02:03:39.224
- You were drunk!
- I've actually never been that drunk.

02:03:39.363 --> 02:03:40.489
Wait!

02:03:42.366 --> 02:03:44.425
There is something I want to say to you.

02:03:44.602 --> 02:03:48.766
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

02:03:49.707 --> 02:03:50.833
Go on, then.

02:03:53.177 --> 02:03:54.508
I love you.

02:03:58.082 --> 02:03:59.913
As do I.

02:04:00.051 --> 02:04:03.509
Always have. Always will.

02:04:08.025 --> 02:04:09.515
I gotta go.

02:04:09.660 --> 02:04:10.684
Jack!

02:04:12.997 --> 02:04:14.589
This is not over!

02:04:15.666 --> 02:04:16.724
Jack!

02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:27.800
Missed!

02:04:43.095 --> 02:04:46.121
The Revenge is mine.

02:04:52.804 --> 02:04:54.271
Sir...

02:04:56.742 --> 02:04:58.607
We found this below decks.

02:05:24.703 --> 02:05:26.967
All hands!
Ply to windward!

02:05:27.105 --> 02:05:30.666
Get cracking,
ye blooming cockroaches!

02:05:33.378 --> 02:05:35.972
The Crown served me well.

02:05:36.114 --> 02:05:39.106
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

02:05:39.251 --> 02:05:43.347
...make way for Tortuga!

02:05:54.466 --> 02:05:57.629
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback,
you made it!

02:05:57.769 --> 02:05:59.327
Aye!

02:05:59.471 --> 02:06:01.063
And I trust we managed a profit

02:06:01.206 --> 02:06:05.370
- from our joint enterprise?
- Feast your eyes.

02:06:10.448 --> 02:06:12.973
The compass led me straight and true.

02:06:13.118 --> 02:06:15.109
What of Blackbeard's men
guarding the ship?

02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:19.122
I employed the selfsame maneuver
we perfected in New Guinea.

02:06:19.224 --> 02:06:23.320
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

02:06:23.461 --> 02:06:25.520
Shame indeed.

02:06:37.476 --> 02:06:38.841
I hate that monkey.

02:06:38.978 --> 02:06:42.414
So, the Pearl...
Any idea how to get her out?

02:06:42.548 --> 02:06:45.574
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.

02:06:45.718 --> 02:06:48.744
One of us must learn to play the trumpet
whilst the other one goes like this...

02:06:49.255 --> 02:06:52.554
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this.

02:06:55.194 --> 02:06:56.855
Jack, I have to ask...

02:06:56.996 --> 02:06:59.863
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

02:06:59.999 --> 02:07:02.524
You could have lived maybe forever.

02:07:02.668 --> 02:07:04.636
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

02:07:04.804 --> 02:07:07.705
But better to not know
which moment may be your last.

02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:09.865
Every morsel of your entire being

02:07:10.009 --> 02:07:13.103
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

02:07:13.246 --> 02:07:15.771
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?

02:07:15.915 --> 02:07:19.043
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

02:07:19.185 --> 02:07:22.086
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

02:07:22.221 --> 02:07:24.212
It's a pirate's life for me.

02:07:25.157 --> 02:07:26.647
Savvy?

WEBVTT

01:34.730 --> 01:36.490
You can't do that in here.

01:42.490 --> 01:43.490
Okay.

01:44.210 --> 01:46.010
Who the fuck are you two?

01:46.210 --> 01:48.690
Us?

01:50.155 --> 01:52.330
We're...

04:41.640 --> 04:42.640
Sammy?

04:42.760 --> 04:43.880
Fruit, please.

04:44.240 --> 04:44.840
Okie dokie.

04:45.200 --> 04:45.400
Honey?

04:45.720 --> 04:46.400
Eat the protein.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.600
I am good.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.560
Clean your plate, please.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.280
Hey, that's dad's.

04:53.795 --> 04:55.300
Hey, cut them some slack, okay?

04:55.460 --> 04:56.460
Always.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.340
Hold on.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.240
I love you.

04:59.400 --> 04:59.860
I love you.

05:00.180 --> 05:00.560
Hey, babe.

05:00.920 --> 05:01.460
My friends are here.

05:01.680 --> 05:02.680
Okay.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.680
Have a nice...

05:05.220 --> 05:06.220
Hey, hon.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.600
I selected the basement so it wouldn't
wake you.

05:09.180 --> 05:10.180
Uh-huh.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.460
Okay, where's Brady?

05:11.600 --> 05:12.800
I want to hear about the game.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.080
Well, the other team was kind of,
you know, physical.

05:20.081 --> 05:20.740
Yeah?

05:20.990 --> 05:23.080
So he, um...

05:23.700 --> 05:24.700
I'll let him tell you.

05:25.060 --> 05:26.060
Very busy day.

05:26.650 --> 05:28.400
We've got three showings and one condo.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.480
I'll let you tell you.

05:31.010 --> 05:32.010
And, uh... Oh.

05:32.760 --> 05:33.620
Brady, sell your coffee.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.296
You're gonna have to make some more for
me.

05:35.320 --> 05:35.740
Uh... Gotcha.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.080
You're bleeding.

05:38.410 --> 05:41.200
All right, we should, uh...

05:44.880 --> 05:45.880
Oh, damn it.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.040
Hey!

05:47.041 --> 05:48.660
Hey, buddy!

06:15.820 --> 06:16.820
What's up, hon?

06:18.680 --> 06:19.880
You know...

06:22.990 --> 06:24.960
Summer breaks in just a few days.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.260
And... We should do
something as a family.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.560
Yeah.

06:29.900 --> 06:30.980
I'll make a plan.

06:31.810 --> 06:34.000
Today I'll make a plan and I'll tell you
tonight.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.700
I'll make lasagna.

06:35.701 --> 06:36.920
Sure.

06:37.460 --> 06:38.540
No, I can do it.

06:39.220 --> 06:41.500
I have one assignment today.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.160
But then tonight you'll see the whole
thing planned out.

06:56.690 --> 06:57.690
What's going on?

07:01.500 --> 07:02.500
None of mine.

08:13.030 --> 08:14.110
Here you are.

08:27.010 --> 08:28.520
Looks like your day went long.

08:30.230 --> 08:35.440
It was a bit more big, a bit more than the
prep set it would be.

08:37.700 --> 08:38.700
The data card.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.650
It was a straightforward snatch.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.570
It started as a straightforward snatch.

08:56.380 --> 08:57.940
You guys haven't fun at the convention?

08:59.630 --> 09:03.110
Asshole, why aren't I here for the fucking
convention?

09:07.390 --> 09:08.450
Where's the card?

09:35.350 --> 09:38.410
Where's the card?

10:33.130 --> 10:33.670
Where's it?

10:33.671 --> 10:34.671
Straightforward snatch.

10:34.700 --> 10:38.010
Yeah, until of course they couldn't show
it up with the booties.

10:43.590 --> 10:46.170
No, they had MP7s.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.140
With MP7s.

11:03.410 --> 11:06.800
Well, we always suspected there might be
another interested party in the mix.

11:07.940 --> 11:08.940
Only one?

11:17.240 --> 11:25.240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

11:25.241 --> 11:29.600
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:30.790 --> 11:34.390
Might as well take a look at this living
of mine.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.490
Brazilian.

11:42.950 --> 11:43.950
Yeah.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.580
With machetes.

11:46.410 --> 11:47.410
The sharp kind.

11:55.290 --> 11:56.290
Well,

12:09.500 --> 12:10.500
I'd say it was worth it.

12:11.220 --> 12:12.360
Because this checks out you.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.580
Which brings you 800 grand closer.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.980
And how much more do I owe?

12:22.800 --> 12:24.000
30 million, give or take.

12:30.155 --> 12:31.460
Your next mission.

12:38.685 --> 12:39.800
I can't.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.670
Arch, I'm trying to help you pay for
death.

12:45.945 --> 12:52.541
One, we very graciously paid on your behalf
when you burned the Russian stack of money.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.620
Are the rate you're going?

12:59.040 --> 13:01.260
You're paid off with the Op Shank by
Sprint.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.320
Gonna take a day.

13:05.960 --> 13:06.960
I'm gonna take a break.

13:21.650 --> 13:22.650
Good luck.

13:27.130 --> 13:28.250
What do I need luck for?

13:28.990 --> 13:29.990
You.

13:30.450 --> 13:31.450
Take a break.

13:33.390 --> 13:34.950
This job is in your nature.

13:35.970 --> 13:36.970
In nature.

13:37.690 --> 13:38.690
But we're sweet.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.820
Wherever you go.

13:44.690 --> 13:45.690
There you are.

14:13.460 --> 14:15.060
Wild times await.

14:15.660 --> 14:17.560
This summer, drive to Plummerville.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.440
Snack dab in the middle of America.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.260
That

15:00.070 --> 15:01.450
commercial is really old.

15:01.650 --> 15:02.866
Are you sure it's a little place?

15:02.890 --> 15:03.490
Yeah, it's all there.

15:03.730 --> 15:04.290
I checked.

15:04.650 --> 15:08.430
It's the hotel and the water park,
the duck boats and the midway.

15:08.950 --> 15:09.950
What's a duck boat?

15:11.060 --> 15:13.430
It's like a bus that floats.

15:14.070 --> 15:15.370
It's a military vehicle.

15:15.690 --> 15:16.690
Grandpa will love it.

15:17.110 --> 15:18.110
We're bringing grandpa?

15:18.290 --> 15:19.290
We're bringing grandpa?

15:19.730 --> 15:20.730
Yeah, of course.

15:21.510 --> 15:22.510
You know what?

15:23.275 --> 15:24.275
I volunteer to stay home.

15:24.550 --> 15:25.990
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

15:25.991 --> 15:26.790
Yeah, Brady, listen.

15:26.990 --> 15:28.390
This is gonna be the most fun.

15:28.930 --> 15:29.970
What happened to your eye?

15:32.070 --> 15:33.190
Somebody fell me at the end.

15:34.030 --> 15:35.030
What came?

15:35.890 --> 15:36.890
The one you missed.

15:37.290 --> 15:38.290
You're right.

15:38.540 --> 15:40.570
We do need to spend more time together as
a family.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.706
This is one of those places you went when
you were a kid.

15:43.730 --> 15:46.910
Okay, but that makes it sound like I went
to a lot of places, okay?

15:47.110 --> 15:48.510
Dad took us on one vacation.

15:48.970 --> 15:49.970
One.

15:50.110 --> 15:51.110
To Plummerville.

15:56.940 --> 16:01.440
Listen, in life, when
times get tough, you need

16:01.441 --> 16:04.410
to have happy memories
to carry you through.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.350
And I just want to show you guys the place
that made me happiest.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.600
You know, make some memories for you.

16:09.910 --> 16:11.230
Would you let me do that, please?

16:14.890 --> 16:15.350
What?

16:15.550 --> 16:16.650
I don't know this one yet.

16:18.390 --> 16:19.390
Okay.

16:19.790 --> 16:20.430
All right.

16:20.431 --> 16:21.630
Really?

16:22.070 --> 16:23.070
Yeah.

16:23.930 --> 16:25.510
Come on, kids.

16:25.650 --> 16:26.650
It could be an adventure.

16:26.930 --> 16:27.930
An adventure.

16:43.710 --> 16:44.720
Hey, Dad.

16:45.350 --> 16:46.620
You gotta put out the cigar.

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
Secondhand smoke.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.000
No such thing.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.350
Let's do this!

17:10.890 --> 17:11.890
Stop!

17:13.130 --> 17:14.130
Here?

18:04.540 --> 18:06.040
Oldest water park?

18:06.240 --> 18:07.860
Is that something we want to advertise?

18:07.861 --> 18:09.640
Yeah, well, it's historic.

18:11.620 --> 18:13.220
Kids, you're in here.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.520
Oh, we're sharing a room.

18:18.020 --> 18:19.180
And where's Grandpa sleeping?

18:19.360 --> 18:20.440
He's next door.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.220
Oh, how'd you think the kids are too old
to share?

18:24.160 --> 18:25.420
Yeah, I'm sorry.

18:25.860 --> 18:27.600
We can all sleep in the old lodge.

18:28.220 --> 18:29.680
Nah, not gonna happen.

18:31.130 --> 18:32.260
Just for me then.

18:33.400 --> 18:33.820
Fine.

18:34.390 --> 18:35.520
You and I have my room.

18:35.521 --> 18:36.680
Oh, thank you.

18:36.780 --> 18:39.440
Sammy, you got this all to yourself?

18:41.940 --> 18:43.240
The honeymoon suite?

18:44.160 --> 18:45.160
Oh, yeah!

18:45.820 --> 18:47.200
That's what I'm talking about.

18:49.060 --> 18:50.060
Whoo!

18:50.750 --> 18:51.840
Look at that, huh?

18:52.560 --> 18:53.560
Take it in.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.240
Yeah.

18:58.060 --> 19:00.620
This is where business gets done.

19:06.840 --> 19:07.900
You don't like it?

19:08.650 --> 19:10.160
No, I'm taking it in.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.700
It smells of cigars.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.200
But I'm happy that you're happy.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.320
And then we're all together.

19:20.180 --> 19:21.180
It's gonna be great.

19:26.090 --> 19:27.500
Water park time.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.600
Oh, water park.

19:49.960 --> 19:55.200
It's like the tropics mix with Europe.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
Hello?

19:58.180 --> 19:58.520
Close.

19:58.880 --> 19:59.880
Sorry.

19:59.960 --> 20:00.960
What?

20:01.060 --> 20:02.060
There's an incident.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.596
Water park closed for the rest of the day.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.000
For how long?

20:04.100 --> 20:04.860
24 hours.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.500
Here's a coupon for hot dogs.

20:06.780 --> 20:07.120
Come again.

20:07.360 --> 20:07.740
Sorry.

20:07.741 --> 20:10.500
Babe, I'm out of here, kids.

20:11.390 --> 20:12.840
Check it out, the old one.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.400
Hot dogs.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.640
Yo, sir.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.320
Hey,

20:33.255 --> 20:36.070
it's the Great Man's sales family
vacation, boy.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.350
Wait till you see the launch.

20:39.680 --> 20:42.030
You see mosquitoes bigger than this hot
dog?

20:42.031 --> 20:43.031
Oh, God.

20:45.270 --> 20:46.310
Something wrong, pal?

20:50.120 --> 20:51.220
You got a problem?

20:53.460 --> 20:54.460
Uh, no.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.160
Sorry, I was just thinking.

21:07.125 --> 21:09.600
You know, it's not polite to eyeball the
law.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.800
Sorry, officer.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.600
It's Sheriff.

21:16.180 --> 21:17.180
Did I do something wrong?

21:18.240 --> 21:19.240
I don't know.

21:20.990 --> 21:23.250
Um, did you?

21:26.330 --> 21:27.490
Um, Hutch?

21:28.560 --> 21:29.560
Everything's good, huh?

21:30.030 --> 21:31.030
Okay.

21:31.650 --> 21:32.650
Mansell?

21:33.730 --> 21:34.850
Uh, yeah, that's me.

21:35.310 --> 21:35.850
Hot dogs are in.

21:36.070 --> 21:37.070
Thanks.

21:37.850 --> 21:38.850
Enjoy.

21:40.410 --> 21:41.410
Thanks.

21:44.420 --> 21:44.850
Hey.

21:44.851 --> 21:45.851
Hey.

21:47.660 --> 21:49.670
Work the way and look what we got.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.330
Coupang for the arcade.

21:53.310 --> 21:54.310
That's how they get you.

21:54.590 --> 21:55.590
That's how they get you.

21:55.730 --> 21:56.730
All right.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.030
All four food groups in one place.

22:00.390 --> 22:01.390
Thanks, Mom.

22:10.790 --> 22:14.550
I wanted to talk to you about that shiner
you got in the game.

22:14.551 --> 22:15.551
The game?

22:17.810 --> 22:18.890
Sorry, what's that?

22:19.630 --> 22:20.890
I didn't get it in the game.

22:23.030 --> 22:24.750
But you got followed, right?

22:25.170 --> 22:25.310
Yeah.

22:25.890 --> 22:28.250
Can I just, okay, catch my game?

22:29.090 --> 22:30.170
It's not a big deal, right?

22:31.790 --> 22:32.790
I won.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.531
That doesn't make it... Yeah.

22:37.610 --> 22:38.850
I'll be right there.

22:40.330 --> 22:43.030
We will talk about this more later,
okay?

22:43.031 --> 22:43.750
For sure.

22:44.030 --> 22:48.470
Do you

23:01.640 --> 23:02.640
guys want some tickets?

23:03.480 --> 23:04.480
Sure.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.560
Lunch?

23:08.700 --> 23:10.580
Hey, Brady, why don't you get them all
wet?

23:11.440 --> 23:12.440
I have one.

23:19.510 --> 23:20.730
Look at us.

23:21.450 --> 23:23.250
De-compressing like probes.

23:24.450 --> 23:25.450
Yeah.

23:25.710 --> 23:27.910
Is that a badger?

23:27.911 --> 23:28.010
Yeah.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.870
That one.

23:32.270 --> 23:33.270
Hey.

23:33.950 --> 23:34.950
Nerd.

23:35.870 --> 23:38.230
Are you getting some nerds with your
tickets, nerd?

23:41.650 --> 23:42.650
What's up?

23:42.750 --> 23:43.750
Tell me you're sorry.

23:46.110 --> 23:47.110
For what?

23:47.290 --> 23:48.290
For hitting on my girl.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.340
You're giving her tickets, man.

23:51.660 --> 23:52.900
What if I tell you to fuck off?

23:53.630 --> 23:53.970
Did I count?

23:53.971 --> 23:54.971
Okay.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.310
Come on in.

23:58.090 --> 23:59.090
Last chance.

24:00.910 --> 24:04.590
You don't want another Shiner on your
pretty city boy face, do you?

24:06.790 --> 24:07.790
Hey.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.250
Fucking shit!

24:15.390 --> 24:16.550
What are you doing?

24:18.130 --> 24:19.390
I'm coming into my own.

24:19.530 --> 24:20.530
I'm starting a fight.

24:20.970 --> 24:22.350
Sit on the fuck down!

24:26.650 --> 24:27.050
Hey.

24:27.330 --> 24:29.830
Get out of here right now!

24:30.130 --> 24:31.130
Is that your kid?

24:31.330 --> 24:33.730
He's not starting anything.

24:33.910 --> 24:35.246
I've got cameras all over this place.

24:35.270 --> 24:37.846
If you don't get your family right now,
you and I are going to have a problem.

24:37.870 --> 24:40.790
We're leaving.

24:41.870 --> 24:42.470
You heard me?

24:42.810 --> 24:43.070
Okay.

24:43.310 --> 24:44.310
All right, let's go.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.410
Listen, I didn't do shit.

24:46.550 --> 24:47.550
This guy did all of it.

24:48.110 --> 24:49.110
My badger.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.250
Leave it.

24:50.790 --> 24:51.790
Ow!

25:02.820 --> 25:03.620
Brady, hold up.

25:03.820 --> 25:04.820
Hold up, sweetie.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.400
Brady.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.000
What?

25:13.300 --> 25:14.300
I left my phone.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.220
I'll be right back.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.120
No, Hutch!

25:17.360 --> 25:17.600
Hutch!

25:17.780 --> 25:17.920
No!

25:18.260 --> 25:19.260
No!

25:20.600 --> 25:21.600
No!

26:02.930 --> 26:03.930
Look at this!

26:04.890 --> 26:06.590
Is that a phone separator?

26:16.510 --> 26:17.510
How's that feel?

26:18.330 --> 26:19.330
Hutch!

26:26.410 --> 26:28.010
Sir, we were attacked.

26:28.310 --> 26:29.806
And I don't understand why we are here.

26:29.830 --> 26:32.250
I don't understand why those bullies are
not here.

26:32.630 --> 26:33.786
Are we being charged with anything?

26:33.810 --> 26:35.330
Okay, is your son prone to violence?

26:35.960 --> 26:38.010
Is my... are you kidding me?

26:38.090 --> 26:39.090
Ma'am.

26:40.630 --> 26:42.310
I'm just trying to gather some
information.

26:43.990 --> 26:47.851
Sir, if we're not being charged, I'd rather
not answer any more of your questions.

26:49.090 --> 26:51.970
I understand protecting your sister,
Brady.

26:52.630 --> 26:54.270
It's instinctual.

26:55.910 --> 26:58.070
But there are other ways to handle things.

26:59.690 --> 27:00.690
You serious?

27:01.860 --> 27:04.260
You tell me to stay cool, but then you go
and lose your shit?

27:05.390 --> 27:07.250
Which I thought was awesome.

27:07.510 --> 27:10.310
By the way, you know
whether you... No, it wasn't.

27:11.360 --> 27:16.010
I'm just saying, you have to be better
than your old man.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.240
Whatever.

27:43.630 --> 27:44.670
Let's go.

27:45.910 --> 27:46.910
You know?

27:47.290 --> 27:48.290
Not you.

27:48.890 --> 27:49.890
Just Dad.

28:00.620 --> 28:01.620
Sit your ass down.

28:12.045 --> 28:13.045
You know who I am?

28:18.310 --> 28:19.310
No.

28:19.340 --> 28:22.550
But boy, you're sitting by in the
sheriff's desk.

28:22.950 --> 28:23.986
I'm guessing you're somebody.

28:24.010 --> 28:25.010
I am what I am.

28:25.720 --> 28:26.730
My name is Wyatt Mark.

28:28.770 --> 28:29.770
I run this town.

28:30.690 --> 28:31.690
I'm Hutch.

28:31.830 --> 28:33.110
I already know who you are.

28:33.690 --> 28:35.130
You're the tourist fuck that my son.

28:36.250 --> 28:37.250
Shut the fuck up.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.190
Your son was the kid at the arcade.

28:40.390 --> 28:42.190
Shut the fuck up.

28:44.780 --> 28:47.370
Well, your son may have had something to
do with it.

28:47.410 --> 28:49.450
Your son has got an attitude problem.

28:50.210 --> 28:51.570
I'm pretty sure I'm staring at it.

28:53.730 --> 28:56.150
My daddy built this town and he had a
rule.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.870
Tourists get a free pass.

28:59.710 --> 29:00.710
You know why, right?

29:00.970 --> 29:02.630
Bread, butter, and all that.

29:03.970 --> 29:07.717
But for this, your
son Brady, right there,

29:07.718 --> 29:12.971
your son Brady messed
up my son's pitching arm.

29:13.110 --> 29:14.110
I get it.

29:15.270 --> 29:16.270
Do you?

29:17.730 --> 29:18.730
I get it.

29:19.610 --> 29:20.930
I'll make my son apologize.

29:22.350 --> 29:26.370
But you should watch the security camp
footage because one of those guys smacked

29:26.670 --> 29:28.990
my daughter and I lost it.

29:31.990 --> 29:32.990
What would you have done?

29:44.260 --> 29:45.260
Walk him out.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.540
Brady, come on.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.320
So that's it, then?

29:51.620 --> 29:52.620
We can go.

29:53.170 --> 29:54.170
You're yourself in favor.

29:54.940 --> 29:55.940
Keep going.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.080
Get the boys together.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.276
I didn't want to say to leave them alone.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.060
I don't give a fuck what Wyatt says.

30:12.460 --> 30:13.460
Get rid of them.

30:20.760 --> 30:21.940
Can you not?

30:32.470 --> 30:33.980
What the hell, Hutch?

30:35.480 --> 30:36.560
On our first date?

30:36.561 --> 30:37.561
I'm sorry.

30:37.960 --> 30:40.160
You just had to bring that other side of
you.

30:40.870 --> 30:43.440
Brady's already aggressive and do you know
why?

30:45.900 --> 30:46.900
It's because of you.

30:47.550 --> 30:49.240
Because he is watching you.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.600
And what you do?

30:51.445 --> 30:52.445
Look, I lost it.

30:52.740 --> 30:54.120
It's over.

30:54.940 --> 30:55.940
What's in the work bag?

30:58.560 --> 30:59.560
What?

31:00.720 --> 31:01.840
The black bag?

31:03.380 --> 31:04.600
You've been trying to hide it.

31:04.875 --> 31:05.875
Okay, so what's in it?

31:06.060 --> 31:07.440
I'm not here for...

31:08.290 --> 31:09.580
I made a promise to you.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.340
And I meant what I said.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.160
Yeah, I remember that promise.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
Wine?

31:25.270 --> 31:26.320
It's not just any wine.

31:30.260 --> 31:31.280
It's from Puglia.

31:33.020 --> 31:34.020
What were we meant?

31:35.280 --> 31:36.280
And the year.

31:49.180 --> 31:50.180
I'm sorry.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.880
Where'd you find this?

31:56.310 --> 31:57.310
EBay.

31:57.630 --> 31:58.050
EBay?

31:58.590 --> 31:59.590
No.

32:00.090 --> 32:01.390
Until you ordered it?

32:01.580 --> 32:03.930
It took like six weeks.

32:07.270 --> 32:08.270
You planned it.

32:12.720 --> 32:15.190
I knew you were the moment I met you.

32:17.540 --> 32:18.650
I knew you were dangerous.

32:20.490 --> 32:21.950
You were covered in blood.

32:23.950 --> 32:25.210
Good times.

32:26.330 --> 32:27.330
Good times.

32:33.190 --> 32:34.530
Oh, crap.

32:35.410 --> 32:36.650
You've got an eye?

32:41.270 --> 32:42.110
Really?

32:42.111 --> 32:42.190
Really?

32:43.130 --> 32:44.930
This is not a fair fight.

32:45.290 --> 32:46.430
This is not a fair fight.

32:57.490 --> 32:59.440
Sammy, where'd you go?

32:59.540 --> 33:01.460
Sammy, wait for me.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.480
Dad, it's where I am.

33:04.060 --> 33:05.160
You got an A.

33:05.820 --> 33:07.580
I warned you, this is a wonderland.

33:08.660 --> 33:09.660
Ready?

33:10.140 --> 33:11.140
Hi.

33:26.260 --> 33:27.860
Grandpa doesn't know what he's missing.

33:28.620 --> 33:29.940
Duck boats are super fun.

33:30.785 --> 33:32.225
They're trustworthy, but they don't.

33:32.850 --> 33:35.060
Four tickets for the...

33:36.260 --> 33:37.940
That's... That's
not a duck boat.

33:38.460 --> 33:40.100
Oh yeah, you see the big duck on the top?

33:40.380 --> 33:44.000
No, I told my son that a duck boat is a
military vehicle.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.080
More than one conflict.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.041
I'm gonna... Okay, four tickets.

33:50.460 --> 33:51.460
One kid.

33:52.180 --> 33:53.340
We'll hand these out.

33:54.725 --> 33:56.440
Really heavy duty, no spec.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.720
School handedly caused our loss at NOM.

34:06.780 --> 34:07.780
Yes.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.000
Thank you.

34:10.001 --> 34:11.001
Hello.

34:14.540 --> 34:15.821
Sweetie, why don't you sit down?

34:17.300 --> 34:18.300
That's right.

34:18.325 --> 34:19.445
It's like a bus that floats.

34:19.700 --> 34:21.640
It is like a bus that floats.

34:22.140 --> 34:23.140
First down.

34:25.890 --> 34:26.890
You're not coming?

34:26.960 --> 34:29.560
I had too many churros with my macchiato.

34:29.820 --> 34:30.820
I'll see you at the park.

34:31.540 --> 34:32.540
What?

34:32.700 --> 34:33.700
Have fun!

34:34.020 --> 34:35.020
My macchiato.

34:35.960 --> 34:36.960
Eat better!

34:59.620 --> 35:00.710
Looks like it's in the lab.

35:00.990 --> 35:02.890
All right, let's get this party started!

35:04.080 --> 35:05.130
Grab them off my arm.

35:05.650 --> 35:06.130
That's good.

35:06.510 --> 35:07.510
Thank you.

35:08.110 --> 35:09.110
Yeah, yeah.

35:10.570 --> 35:11.890
Headphone should be on the bench.

35:11.970 --> 35:12.790
Trying to seat in the back.

35:12.970 --> 35:13.970
Just get comfortable.

35:14.110 --> 35:15.910
Hold on really tight.

35:16.430 --> 35:17.750
And we'll get going in a minute.

35:18.510 --> 35:19.510
Let's go.

35:38.740 --> 35:39.740
What's up, guys?

35:40.700 --> 35:41.700
What do you know?

35:42.920 --> 35:44.120
You were told to leave.

35:45.420 --> 35:47.060
So what are you still doing in town?

35:47.320 --> 35:48.320
Old man.

35:50.260 --> 35:51.700
I'm here with my family.

35:52.980 --> 35:53.980
Making memories.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.140
Just making memories, huh?

35:58.780 --> 36:00.000
There's no need for this.

36:00.300 --> 36:01.700
This is all a big misunderstanding.

36:05.100 --> 36:06.880
Hey, hold on!

36:11.560 --> 36:12.560
Come on!

36:16.520 --> 36:17.040
Hey!

36:17.500 --> 36:18.500
Use your words!

36:20.360 --> 36:21.360
No

36:52.590 --> 36:53.650
One gets the ball.

36:53.950 --> 36:54.990
But I got a fucking knife!

37:03.860 --> 37:04.980
It's dead, motherfucker!

37:06.160 --> 37:07.160
Hold on.

37:07.300 --> 37:10.100
These waters are going to a native giant
bench.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Cool it, man.

37:12.060 --> 37:12.380
Cool it.

37:12.540 --> 37:13.540
Talk to me, okay?

37:13.980 --> 37:14.980
Think of the children.

37:15.740 --> 37:16.740
What?

37:40.230 --> 37:42.210
That's what I'm fucking talking about!

37:42.615 --> 37:44.450
You said you was just a fucking tourist!

37:45.135 --> 37:46.850
That's all he was fucking told me!

37:47.410 --> 37:49.730
You're going to bet it's a lot more
fucking money now, Dan.

37:50.090 --> 37:51.090
You lost a tooth.

38:50.350 --> 38:51.430
Fuck you!

39:05.890 --> 39:06.890
You were

39:22.570 --> 39:26.630
just being sat near that bar of shamisen,
my brother.

39:26.850 --> 39:29.110
You just got back from Masaka,
right?

39:29.490 --> 39:30.930
Yeah, and I mastered shit quickly.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.170
What's up?

39:33.550 --> 39:35.870
Hey, you remember Plumberville?

39:36.670 --> 39:38.190
One of the happiest weeks of my life.

39:38.350 --> 39:39.350
Yeah, mine too.

39:40.430 --> 39:44.383
Yeah, I remember seeing
the other kids and their

39:44.384 --> 39:48.191
parents and thinking
we were just like them.

39:50.650 --> 39:56.090
And anyway, I came back here and...

39:56.730 --> 39:59.730
Plumberville just isn't as friendly as I
remember it to be.

40:01.270 --> 40:03.930
It's no trade route you since the
bootlegging days.

40:05.110 --> 40:07.930
Why, you think Dad took us there for a one
and only family vacation?

40:09.570 --> 40:11.390
Were you saying he was on a mission?

40:12.310 --> 40:13.310
You got it, Hutchie Boy.

40:14.710 --> 40:15.710
Oh, yeah.

40:16.670 --> 40:19.370
The cops over there, Dan goes with the big
son again.

40:20.070 --> 40:21.770
Hey, careful with that.

40:21.910 --> 40:22.910
It's not my money.

40:22.990 --> 40:23.670
I'm sorry, boss.

40:23.950 --> 40:25.390
I didn't mean to fucking go around.

40:26.230 --> 40:28.710
And they would not want a guy like you
sniffing around, bro.

40:37.860 --> 40:38.860
How's it going?

40:40.300 --> 40:42.120
Holy shit, this is a big shipment.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.020
What's in the Lincoln thing?

40:46.990 --> 40:49.700
The shit that's gonna land Latino in
Interpol's top 10.

40:52.600 --> 40:53.600
This is great.

40:55.070 --> 40:57.511
You want more guys here just in case
there's any more trouble?

41:01.380 --> 41:03.781
Hey, don't cause any trouble, and there
won't be any trouble.

41:04.550 --> 41:05.860
Remember who's boss here.

41:07.900 --> 41:08.900
Got it.

41:12.210 --> 41:13.210
I better get my son.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.120
Watch this shit and be cool.

41:26.280 --> 41:27.340
Want to take that?

41:28.440 --> 41:29.440
Thanks.

41:31.010 --> 41:34.520
We think Dad is eventually gonna grace us
with his presence, or...

41:34.770 --> 41:35.770
Wild animals.

41:36.540 --> 41:38.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:38.720 --> 41:39.720
Don't go too near.

41:39.830 --> 41:40.830
That's wild wolf dog.

41:41.470 --> 41:42.791
That's still locked up, that one.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.580
Well, Mom, you saved your wolf back when
you met Dad, right?

41:47.980 --> 41:48.980
Oh, my god, the things.

41:49.360 --> 41:52.682
But, you know, if you
gain their trust, I'll show

41:52.683 --> 41:55.180
them that the world is
a safe place for them.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.280
The world is safe.

41:57.830 --> 41:58.900
What world is that?

42:01.270 --> 42:02.440
Okay, let's go find Dad.

42:07.420 --> 42:08.950
You caught a tourist, I heard.

42:09.450 --> 42:10.650
You put up a bunch of a fight?

42:14.150 --> 42:14.750
What's it?

42:15.150 --> 42:16.190
I can't hear you.

42:17.790 --> 42:19.030
Hey, turn that off.

42:20.310 --> 42:21.310
Set it off!

42:21.690 --> 42:22.690
What are you doing?

42:24.170 --> 42:25.290
What was that?

42:26.710 --> 42:28.050
Okay, keep that.

42:29.920 --> 42:30.920
What about your teeth?

42:31.650 --> 42:32.970
They crossed, though, okay?

42:33.750 --> 42:35.550
They hit me in every light.

42:36.250 --> 42:38.210
What the fuck are you talking about?

42:39.410 --> 42:41.170
I'll have you at the guide, okay?

42:41.210 --> 42:42.570
I don't think he's just a tourist.

42:50.770 --> 42:51.770
Yes?

42:52.070 --> 42:53.070
I've got a problem.

42:54.125 --> 42:55.790
Of your own making, I said.

42:56.370 --> 42:57.370
Denverville.

42:57.590 --> 42:58.590
You heard of it?

42:59.090 --> 43:00.090
It's a background.

43:01.030 --> 43:03.430
Denver, drugs, guns, viruses and worse.

43:03.750 --> 43:06.970
Come down from Canada and go on to points
unknown.

43:08.050 --> 43:10.210
Where does the buck stop here?

43:11.070 --> 43:12.070
They're a legacy.

43:13.780 --> 43:15.070
Possibly an individual.

43:15.620 --> 43:18.210
A unique individual called Landina.

43:20.490 --> 43:21.490
Landina.

43:32.240 --> 43:32.600
Wait.

43:32.960 --> 43:33.960
Yes, ma'am.

43:37.660 --> 43:38.980
No, no, no, no deal.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.460
This requires a woman's touch.

43:41.010 --> 43:42.820
I'm winning on a roll here.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.160
Congratulations.

43:44.580 --> 43:45.900
See how your luck goes.

43:49.370 --> 43:50.420
Beautiful eyes.

43:50.620 --> 43:51.620
Split.

43:52.640 --> 43:53.640
Sure.

43:54.200 --> 43:54.920
Hit me.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.560
So how's your trip been going so far?

43:56.800 --> 43:57.800
Shut up, Indio.

43:58.480 --> 44:01.500
Plumberville is critical to Landina's
larger empire.

44:01.920 --> 44:02.940
Oh, shit.

44:02.941 --> 44:03.941
Aw.

44:05.370 --> 44:06.370
It happens.

44:08.020 --> 44:12.160
A lone wolf operates unburdened by any
constraints.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.400
At all.

44:15.340 --> 44:17.781
You piss off the Russian as they come to
your house with guns.

44:18.620 --> 44:22.380
Landina and her squad will sway your
family on the front lawn and force you to

44:22.381 --> 44:26.840
watch if you disrupt their situations any
further.

44:30.840 --> 44:31.840
Yes.

44:32.460 --> 44:33.460
Ha-ha.

44:33.800 --> 44:34.800
Hey, me.

44:35.640 --> 44:36.720
Ha-ha-ha.

44:36.721 --> 44:39.700
Ha-ha-ha.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.460
I am winner.

44:42.780 --> 44:44.240
I swear, I knew nothing.

44:44.820 --> 44:45.820
No!

44:46.480 --> 44:47.480
No!

44:47.920 --> 44:48.920
No!

44:49.280 --> 44:50.280
No!

44:52.480 --> 44:54.620
Nobody sees in my casino!

44:55.920 --> 44:56.920
Nobody sees in my casino!

44:57.360 --> 44:58.360
Yes!

45:01.860 --> 45:04.560
You want to de-escalate the situation.

45:05.420 --> 45:09.720
I mean, do you got any intel and address
or anything?

45:10.960 --> 45:12.160
I don't know if you're a lead.

45:12.820 --> 45:13.820
But hear me on this.

45:16.060 --> 45:17.060
You're on your own, Arch.

45:17.820 --> 45:18.820
Killer.

45:18.980 --> 45:21.220
This was so easy, but I did see it now.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.600
You know, you should never see those
terrible, terrible people.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.580
What about them back there?

45:29.620 --> 45:30.620
They've got witnesses.

45:30.820 --> 45:31.820
Burn it down.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.060
You got it.

45:41.100 --> 45:42.600
That was fast.

45:42.920 --> 45:43.920
Did it hurt?

45:44.380 --> 45:45.380
No, I'm fine.

45:46.350 --> 45:47.350
Maybe this is too soon.

45:48.200 --> 45:49.480
That really, I'm fine.

45:50.020 --> 45:51.020
My arm's feeling good.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.400
Hold on.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.220
Max, I have to take this damn call.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.400
It won't be long.

46:00.980 --> 46:01.980
What?

46:02.140 --> 46:05.780
Well, that's no way to treat your business
partner.

46:06.760 --> 46:07.760
Ex-partner.

46:08.270 --> 46:09.280
This is my last shipment.

46:09.580 --> 46:10.940
Oh, goodness.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.120
My father's death is all paid up.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.160
I can count.

46:18.280 --> 46:21.720
This, you know, pays off the last of our
debt.

46:22.835 --> 46:26.680
By my calculations, the debt will never be
paid off.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.921
That's bullshitting, you know it.

46:31.820 --> 46:33.720
Ain't nothing funny about what I said.

46:34.940 --> 46:37.880
Your father died because he was
distracted.

46:38.940 --> 46:39.940
Are you distracted?

46:40.680 --> 46:41.680
I'm not my dad.

46:42.240 --> 46:43.240
It's over.

46:45.310 --> 46:48.060
Well then, we'll see.

46:51.340 --> 46:52.340
Well...

46:52.720 --> 46:53.720
Hello?

47:01.240 --> 47:02.620
Hey, Max, where are you going?

47:13.260 --> 47:15.190
Sheriff, you can just call me.

47:16.590 --> 47:17.590
Sheriff.

47:18.140 --> 47:20.990
I need to make sure Wyatt hasn't forgotten
who he works for.

47:22.610 --> 47:25.010
Take something that really matters to him.

47:25.990 --> 47:26.990
Got it.

47:34.670 --> 47:35.670
Mom, it's your turn.

47:36.420 --> 47:37.760
Hey, Mom.

47:38.380 --> 47:38.700
Yes?

47:39.180 --> 47:40.180
Dad, in trouble again?

47:41.810 --> 47:42.931
Why, did you know something?

47:44.180 --> 47:45.180
No, that's fine.

47:45.400 --> 47:45.500
No.

47:46.100 --> 47:47.100
I'm sure you did.

47:50.490 --> 47:51.490
No, you didn't.

48:02.930 --> 48:03.410
Handbaggers!

48:03.910 --> 48:04.910
Hand spores!

48:05.390 --> 48:06.390
I did it tonight.

48:06.650 --> 48:07.650
Ah, so nutritious.

48:07.950 --> 48:08.950
Yay!

48:09.790 --> 48:11.450
Your dad's running late.

48:12.570 --> 48:13.570
Come with me.

48:14.150 --> 48:15.930
I promise you it's the way to go.

48:16.550 --> 48:17.290
Amy, come on.

48:17.510 --> 48:17.950
I'll be back up.

48:18.290 --> 48:18.870
You talk to him.

48:19.170 --> 48:19.810
Talk to him.

48:20.090 --> 48:21.090
Got to move.

48:21.610 --> 48:22.610
Okay.

48:26.065 --> 48:29.350
Walk in real smooth.

48:30.070 --> 48:32.470
Keep everything room temp.

48:33.130 --> 48:35.290
Now, go escalating.

48:36.070 --> 48:37.510
De-escalate.

48:38.370 --> 48:40.110
Lead by example.

48:41.150 --> 48:42.590
Hey, fellas.

48:43.710 --> 48:44.870
What a mix-up.

48:48.290 --> 48:51.270
It's a big shipment, but I
guarantee you we can do

48:51.271 --> 48:53.831
more next time, except
those paintings are a bitch.

48:54.680 --> 48:55.961
But you guys see what's in here?

49:01.900 --> 49:03.861
Here is the special thing the boss lady
asked for.

49:04.630 --> 49:06.090
Why spoil son?

49:07.530 --> 49:13.310
I want you to tell the boss that I said it
was a pleasure to be of service.

49:13.830 --> 49:14.050
Okay?

49:14.051 --> 49:15.750
You understand?

49:17.850 --> 49:19.491
Or do I need to get a fucking translator?

49:22.630 --> 49:24.031
I need to get a fucking translator.

49:26.490 --> 49:27.490
Hey, fellas.

49:28.510 --> 49:30.050
Boss, how did you get in here?

49:30.890 --> 49:31.890
The door.

49:32.930 --> 49:33.930
Is that gasoline?

49:34.710 --> 49:35.710
You're quick.

49:40.590 --> 49:43.140
I said I could torch this money and go up
in a flash.

49:43.930 --> 49:47.460
Whatever's in those barrels will go boom,
and most of you wouldn't make it out of

49:47.461 --> 49:50.640
here, and those who do will have to answer
till andina.

49:52.360 --> 49:54.020
I'm guessing this is all hers.

49:56.460 --> 49:57.821
So then what the fuck do you want?

50:01.540 --> 50:02.580
Okay, well...

50:02.830 --> 50:03.830
I want a break.

50:04.200 --> 50:05.200
A break?

50:05.840 --> 50:07.540
I just want a fucking break.

50:08.870 --> 50:12.680
So if I walk out of here, you leave me and
my family alone.

50:13.790 --> 50:14.831
Because that's all I want.

50:15.440 --> 50:16.840
To de-escalate this.

50:18.960 --> 50:20.240
Are you fucking kidding me?

50:21.600 --> 50:25.040
From the moment you've shown up,
you've put my men in the fucking ER.

50:25.220 --> 50:27.460
There's no way you were just some family
man.

50:29.090 --> 50:30.090
De-escalate?

50:30.160 --> 50:31.160
Fuck you.

50:31.700 --> 50:33.860
Hummerville was a-okay before you showed
up.

50:35.580 --> 50:38.040
Wherever I go...

50:38.940 --> 50:41.440
I could so easily kill you right now.

50:47.660 --> 50:49.221
But... you're lucky.

50:51.380 --> 50:52.840
You catch me on a good day.

50:56.520 --> 50:57.520
Go.

50:58.430 --> 50:59.620
Get the fuck out of here.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.000
Go before I change my mind.

51:32.850 --> 51:33.890
Fucking-

51:59.020 --> 52:00.380
That's fucking nerve.

52:00.680 --> 52:02.480
I told you to get the fuck out of here.

53:32.480 --> 53:33.480
Okay, let's go.

53:43.320 --> 53:44.320
Stop it, fuck it!

54:45.860 --> 54:46.860
How much did we lose?

54:47.200 --> 54:48.200
Everything.

54:48.440 --> 54:50.440
The cash, the chemicals, the bio-case.

54:51.220 --> 54:51.560
No.

54:52.020 --> 54:53.020
All of it.

54:53.380 --> 54:56.120
Wiped out all our men and got away with
Wyatt's son.

55:02.210 --> 55:03.210
Who is the silent?

55:03.950 --> 55:05.250
Nothing about him is turning up.

55:05.650 --> 55:07.210
There is one oddity.

55:09.080 --> 55:11.230
He had a family with him.

55:12.190 --> 55:16.550
My valuable shipment
was blown up by a man

55:16.551 --> 55:21.191
who's a tourist on a
fucking family vacation.

55:23.760 --> 55:25.970
Does nobody play by the rules anymore?

55:27.090 --> 55:28.610
Jesus fucking Christ.

55:29.780 --> 55:33.130
I don't know who the fuck you are,
but you crossed a line asshole.

55:34.430 --> 55:35.430
Sheriff.

55:38.300 --> 55:39.701
What do you know about this threat?

55:40.230 --> 55:42.030
I don't know, okay?

55:42.390 --> 55:45.350
But I sent you the pictures, and they
haven't checked out of the hotel.

55:46.010 --> 55:47.790
You might want to bring some others,
right?

55:47.791 --> 55:52.070
How many of your, I guess, soldiers can
you bring with you?

55:52.330 --> 55:53.991
Because he's...
Shut the fuck up.

55:54.570 --> 55:55.570
I'm on my way.

55:56.575 --> 55:57.850
This guy's an idiot.

56:01.230 --> 56:02.230
Hey, son.

56:02.290 --> 56:03.330
Look who finally shows up.

56:03.390 --> 56:04.390
Hey, dad.

56:04.530 --> 56:05.210
Everybody good?

56:05.430 --> 56:07.470
Oh, everybody's doing great.

56:08.280 --> 56:10.770
Your sound swing's a lot like a pro.

56:11.950 --> 56:12.950
Dad.

56:13.330 --> 56:13.810
Sammy.

56:13.990 --> 56:14.530
How are you?

56:14.531 --> 56:15.531
I'm good.

56:16.430 --> 56:17.850
Oh, hey Brady, that's Max.

56:18.090 --> 56:19.910
I brought him here, so be cool.

56:25.720 --> 56:26.720
Good?

56:27.480 --> 56:28.480
Yeah.

56:29.590 --> 56:32.220
It's going to have to get that shiner
country boy.

56:33.660 --> 56:33.880
Good.

56:34.400 --> 56:35.561
You're staying for the night?

56:36.050 --> 56:40.900
I would love to stay, but I still got some
heavy lifting to do.

56:42.790 --> 56:43.790
You're right about that.

56:48.860 --> 56:50.660
Let's go, Sammy.

56:51.740 --> 56:52.740
Come on.

56:53.980 --> 56:55.400
You can light the fire.

57:06.980 --> 57:07.980
Arms length, Hutch.

57:09.030 --> 57:11.010
You're supposed to keep danger at arms
length.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.290
I didn't mean to.

57:15.550 --> 57:17.090
Hutch, you promised me.

57:18.570 --> 57:19.570
You promised.

57:21.910 --> 57:22.990
You broke your promise.

57:26.150 --> 57:27.450
I don't have...

57:29.360 --> 57:30.770
I don't have control over this.

57:32.270 --> 57:39.970
I'm just realizing that you should get
away from me.

57:44.970 --> 57:46.730
Like a...

57:47.850 --> 57:49.831
Like a... I'm not asking.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.210
You don't tell me what to do.

57:57.570 --> 58:02.190
There were a lot of things that most of
all, you're a dad.

58:03.940 --> 58:04.940
And you're my guy.

58:07.380 --> 58:08.530
So don't fix that shit.

58:16.190 --> 58:18.230
Come on, Sean, answer your damn phone.

58:20.460 --> 58:21.630
Come on, come on, come on.

58:36.200 --> 58:37.681
I'm... You.

58:38.720 --> 58:40.481
What the hell are you still doing to my
town?

58:40.870 --> 58:42.380
Well, I could use your help.

58:43.290 --> 58:45.940
No, no, no.

58:46.040 --> 58:47.400
Be cool, I've got your son.

58:48.920 --> 58:49.680
He's okay.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.760
That's why my sons were a dead man.

58:52.700 --> 58:53.820
You don't understand.

58:54.460 --> 58:55.460
He's totally safe.

58:55.640 --> 58:58.720
What the fuck do you mean?

58:58.721 --> 58:59.721
He's like safe.

59:00.580 --> 59:02.340
From my data.

59:05.810 --> 59:08.700
We want the same things.

59:21.950 --> 59:22.950
You burned all of it?

59:23.960 --> 59:24.960
Yep.

59:25.790 --> 59:26.790
You burned the money.

59:28.660 --> 59:32.120
And whatever was in those chemical perils,
they'd be exploded.

59:32.720 --> 59:34.000
You burned all of it?

59:35.200 --> 59:36.200
I saved your son.

59:38.660 --> 59:39.660
Thanks.

59:42.520 --> 59:43.960
She's pure fucking evil, man.

59:46.445 --> 59:47.445
She killed my dad.

59:48.630 --> 59:50.020
Used able to take my son.

59:52.360 --> 59:53.680
Backstabbing son of a bitch.

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:10.550
This empire that I inherited from my dad
came with a lot of debts.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:13.390
Wild Bill.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.630
He was a lot of fun for the man like the
bad odds.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.500
And I'm still paying for his mistakes.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.780
Latina has run this town for two fucking
generations.

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.660
I will not let my son be forced into this.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.520
I know what you mean.

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:45.620
So what would she do if she found that you
burned her stash?

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480
You burned?

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.060
Okay, what would she do?

01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:59.200
Okay, how do I put this?

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.840
She's eradicated entire blood mines for
less.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.060
She's absolutely bad shit crazy.

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:10.760
Fishes.

01:01:10.761 --> 01:01:12.260
Where

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.920
is she right now?

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.880
She's definitely on her way here.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.560
Man, it's time.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.880
Hit

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.420
it, motherfuckers!

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.760
We had

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:58.130
plans to fight Lindina.

01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:00.390
She got some first.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.470
I'm not sure if any of it still works.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.220
I wouldn't.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.640
Now we lead her to the most dangerous
place in Plumberville.

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:18.860
Call for repair.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.840
Hey, we just got you.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.380
So sorry.

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.860
Postman has got to be made safe.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:22.440
There you go.

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.580
He got three tools.

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.020
You're gonna get a free refund.

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:25.480
Let's go!

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:25.960
Let's go!

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.060
Now!

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.140
It must be hard to say goodbye to this
place.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.560
You know, when my dad
brought us here... It's a curse.

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:43.310
What a park leaves like a motherfucker.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.040
The funhouse is nothing but headaches.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.120
No kid wants exactly what their dad built.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.580
Really?

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.301
It's actually good to hear.

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.420
Who the fuck is that?

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.340
Harry?

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.181
You know, this place is much smaller than
I remember.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.500
Oh, man!

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.340
This is my brother.

01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:00.840
Harry!

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040
Why, Martin?

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.100
Good to meet you.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.180
What are you doing here?

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.060
I sense you was having an existential
crisis.

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:24.811
You know, pops, remember
that you left us alone in

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.920
that lodge for two nights
straight by ourselves.

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:29.940
And what we had to eat was hot dogs and
s'mores.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.800
That's probably why I'm a vegan.

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:34.820
Well, you guys were safe.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.880
Mostly.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:38.736
Do you ever worry about us though?

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.820
I mean, like, who we'd become.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:44.310
You mean, like, how you worry about Grady?

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.580
Yeah.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:48.860
I want him to be... A
better man than you.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.640
Yeah.

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:52.040
And he will be.

01:04:52.950 --> 01:05:00.300
Believe it or not, you guys are
improvements on me.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.680
Hey, listen.

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:04.640
You know where you're headed?

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:05.560
I got it.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.180
Okay, you need any help up there?

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.140
Yeah, I got something else in mind.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:39.520
What's that?

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.860
Some sort of cabin.

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.180
We think his family's there.

01:05:44.235 --> 01:05:45.260
Take a team and go there.

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:46.500
The cartage.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:47.300
Yes.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.500
Scorched earth.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720
No prisoners.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.540
They need a little bit of chocolate
inside.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:59.980
If you're going to open this one,
you know what you're doing?

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:00.860
Yes, I do.

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:03.840
After all the offense, you just jump here.

01:06:05.605 --> 01:06:09.600
Um, kids, I'm gonna go for a walk.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:10.620
Have fun.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040
What?

01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:14.050
You got this, Grady?

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.560
I'm gonna go for a walk.

01:06:16.561 --> 01:06:17.600
Yeah.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.560
Be safe.

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.260
Like,

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.480
and the new look really suits you,
ain't it?

01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:57.600
You kid-mapping lookalike.

01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.220
Cute.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.220
You really lit a fuse when you did that.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.080
No.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:08.640
I think you did that the moment you
underestimated me.

01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:13.520
See, I've been pushed around for long
enough.

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:18.380
So from now on, I'm the fucking man.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.660
And this is my fucking town.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.120
So give me your guns.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.540
Walk in front of me, back to the car,
and maybe I'll get you out of this.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.500
Maybe.

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:35.460
What if we say no?

01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:38.360
All hell breaks loose.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:45.180
Yeah, we'll take that.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.160
What an ass-pain he is.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:07:59.600
Take him out.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.880
Copy that.

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.220
Open fire!

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:43.740
Move.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.460
Hey, fellas.

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:08.050
What the fuck?

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:41.980
Hey, quiet.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:42.840
Meet me at the pool.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.080
I'm on my way.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:47.960
What the six?

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.250
You are a goat.

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.420
Look at this!

01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:52.230
Whoever's in there, never leaves.

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:59.986
The master's family
direct us, ape to console,

01:12:59.987 --> 01:13:02.871
and bomb this left-feeling
hands to strangle.

01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:13.010
Fuck!

01:13:13.011 --> 01:13:15.490
What the fuck?

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:34.010
To a challenge, and to opportunity.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:36.770
The fifth person.

01:13:36.771 --> 01:13:38.770
What the fuck?

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880
Hey, come here.

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:02.140
Don't do this.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.940
And just do my job here.

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:06.300
Max!

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:07.840
Protect Sammy!

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.720
As soon as he challenged me, I took his
head.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:23.540
Take him away.

01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:36.510
Don't wait on the city to a fucking katana
duel.

01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:38.190
That's possible, not one.

01:14:44.295 --> 01:14:46.150
Please, don't get going.

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.820
What's up, nephew?

01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:05.711
Your father will be proud of you,
Brady.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.240
What?

01:15:07.675 --> 01:15:09.680
I got shot in the fucking leg.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.010
All right.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.240
Hold that on there.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.320
Thanks.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.600
All right.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.340
I'm going to check on my dad.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.520
Dad!

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.700
Dundina?

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:43.900
Who sent you?

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.250
Nobody.

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:50.090
I'm here with my family, making memories.

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.140
What are you doing here?

01:15:54.725 --> 01:15:55.725
I'm here for you.

01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:59.910
You know, I like this little empire of
mine.

01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:06.250
Operative or a family man, it doesn't
fucking matter because what I don't like

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:10.250
is people who try to fuck up my peace of
mind.

01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:14.650
But you know, I'm just like that.

01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:17.410
Ah!

01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:34.778
If it isn't Mr.

01:16:49.728 --> 01:16:53.500
Makin' Memories what
happened to my ties on the beach?

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:58.640
Don't just go and leave a trail of
destruction.

01:16:58.641 --> 01:17:00.620
Everywhere you go.

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:05.160
Do you know how important this town is for
my business?

01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:07.051
What the fuck are you thinking?

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:10.160
FBI Park Ranger?

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.140
Fuck!

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:12.880
You are a nobody.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.600
And how?

01:17:15.775 --> 01:17:17.280
You're going to lose everything.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.980
And do you want to know why, buddy?

01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:24.760
Because you fucked with the wrong bitch.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.640
Take him out.

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.700
I'm bored with him.

01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:58.630
Now, fuck face.

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:01.630
You think you can get away with this.

01:18:02.410 --> 01:18:04.250
You need a lesson, asshole.

01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:08.210
Fuck your memories.

01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:09.910
Fuck your family.

01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:12.930
And most of all, fuck you.

01:18:13.770 --> 01:18:15.550
Die, fucker!

01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:23.370
Fuck!

01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:29.910
Who are you?

01:18:34.075 --> 01:18:35.075
I must better have.

01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:47.590
Fuck!

01:18:47.591 --> 01:18:48.591
Back up!

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.160
Kill her.

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:23.250
What?

01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:24.310
You heard the boss.

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:25.890
Kill her.

01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:26.930
Fire!

01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:29.490
And now, fuck her.

01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:32.010
Oh, I think you're in trouble.

01:19:32.011 --> 01:19:33.011
I love you.

01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:35.010
I love you.

01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:37.770
I'm in trouble.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.480
I'm so beautiful.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.840
Whenever you reach for me.

01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:03.320
I want you.

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:05.060
All night, all night, yeah.

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.120
Are they going to be okay?

01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:09.540
Yeah.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.240
Just another man's so fake.

01:20:11.241 --> 01:20:12.241
Okay, sir.

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.020
We're

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.260
not gonna ask again.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.160
Who are you guys?

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:08.920
Us?

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.381
We're uh... We're married.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.560
Yeah, we're married.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Yeah.

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:41.450
Sir, I cannot do that.

01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:43.670
There are bodies all over.

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:45.150
This is like a war zone.

01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:46.810
I...

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:48.570
Yes, sir.

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.140
Yes, sir, I hear you.

01:21:52.225 --> 01:21:53.850
Loud and clear, sir.

01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:55.110
Yes.

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.420
You're free to go.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.760
Get the keys.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.240
For the cops.

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:20.570
Hutch, after this vacation?

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:22.210
Yeah.

01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:24.170
We need a vacation.

01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:31.710
We did it!

01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:37.290
We went to Plummerville, and we came back
in one piece.

01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:39.390
Yes!

01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:40.670
Yes!

01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:42.010
Almost.

01:22:42.670 --> 01:22:45.510
Now listen, one thing that will help us
never forget.

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:46.810
Yeah, so let's hear it.

01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:48.910
What is the idea with this one?

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:50.430
Max and Lauren!

01:22:50.710 --> 01:22:51.870
Did you call them sometimes?

01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:54.050
Honey, I think we've caused them enough
trouble.

01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:56.630
We can't wait for the next summer break.

01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:58.410
We'll come with us, right, Grandpa?

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:00.110
I miss that.

WEBVTT

01:21.581 --> 01:23.500
Your breakfast, Mr. Soliman.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.877
I don't care about cantaloupe!

01:25.919 --> 01:28.046
-Tastes like melon! -It will
never happen again, I promise.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.798
-Yalla, habibi, come back!
-Just going to clean up.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.175
-I'll be very fast.
-I'm not done yelling at you!

01:47.941 --> 01:49.692
Unit two, I've lost camera four.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.444
We need eyes
on the rooftop terrace.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.530
I'm in.
Okay, Mr. Shark, you're up.

01:53.571 --> 01:54.864
Nice work, rookie.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.741
-I'm on my way.
-Yasmin told me

01:56.783 --> 01:58.743
-I need to be more attentive.
-What?

01:58.785 --> 02:00.578
You are very attentive.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.623
I know. That's what I told her.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.083
Yalla, did you get a haircut?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.584
I did.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.129
-Thank you for noticing.
-It's very nice.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.338
All clear on the roof.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.714
Copy that.

02:11.756 --> 02:12.757
Uh, that was me.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.217
-It-It's still Shark.
-Yeah, no.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.677
I got that. Thank you.

02:15.718 --> 02:18.638
All right,
Mr. Piranha, go crazy.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.106
Mr. Snake, that's your cue.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.482
Hope your timing's right, kid.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.110
Snake, be nice to the rookie.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.653
It's her first heist.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.281
I was being nice.
It's just how I sound.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.158
Welcome to the team.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.284
See?

02:39.325 --> 02:40.618
All right.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.287
We finished, uh,
with the banter?

02:42.328 --> 02:43.371
Let's do this.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.206
Come on. Five.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.958
-Four.
-Three.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.251
-Two.
-One.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.086
It's showtime.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.817
Hello, Mr. Soliman.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.656
The Bad Guys!

03:18.698 --> 03:19.991
Remind me again:

03:20.033 --> 03:21.618
Why didn't you just
come through the front door?

03:21.659 --> 03:23.995
-Where's the fun in that?
-He loves an entrance.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.206
Stay back, you... you monsters!

03:26.247 --> 03:28.041
Monsters?

03:28.082 --> 03:29.459
Wow.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.960
-Did he just say "monsters"?
-He did.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.253
I wouldn't have done that.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.214
You like monsters?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.884
I'll show you a monster, pal.

03:48.102 --> 03:51.231
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-P-Please.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.859
-Whoa.
-Okay, I see you.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.736
-Check this out. -No, no.
No, no, please. Mr. Wolf.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.240
Oh, baby, where have you been
all my life?

04:00.281 --> 04:01.532
No! No!

04:01.574 --> 04:03.368
-No, no.
-Not bad. Not bad.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.036
This is... this is
a one-of-a-kind prototype.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.454
Shiny!

04:06.496 --> 04:08.957
Wait. We did all this
for a car?

04:08.998 --> 04:12.919
Listen, kid, the heist is never
really about the loot, okay?

04:12.961 --> 04:15.672
-It's a power move, baby.
--Let's go.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.548
I-I have to say--
No, no. No, this--

04:17.590 --> 04:19.300
It's never been driven!

04:19.342 --> 04:21.010
Don't worry.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.054
We brought you
a little parting gift.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.597
We're classy like that.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.392
For me?

04:31.145 --> 04:32.397
Nice.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.941
Ooh, you say
the naughtiest things.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.162
No! No!

04:48.204 --> 04:50.373
You Bad Guys will never
get away with this!

05:02.969 --> 05:04.429

05:04.470 --> 05:05.596

07:57.560 --> 07:59.395

08:00.188 --> 08:03.941

ever agai--

08:09.655 --> 08:12.116
Nice carbon footprint, jackass!

08:12.158 --> 08:13.284
Classy.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.291
Come on. Easy, now. Easy, easy.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.210
Come on, girl. You got this.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.463
Ugh.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.637
Oh, hey. Look who it is.

08:32.678 --> 08:33.888
Get over here.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.973
Where you been
keeping yourselves?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.308
Me?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.101
Oh, terrific.

08:39.143 --> 08:40.436
Fantastic.

08:40.478 --> 08:41.771
I mean,
not everyone believes it,

08:41.812 --> 08:45.316
but, uh, the Bad Guys went good.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.943
I'll spare you the details,

08:46.984 --> 08:49.779
but in a nutshell,
we felt the wag of doing good.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.155
Made a couple of new friends...

08:51.197 --> 08:52.198
Diane?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.158
You're the Crimson Paw?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.536
We took down Marmalade,
a real bad guy.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.120
The Crimson Paw!

08:58.162 --> 09:00.706
Me? No, no, no.
She's the Crimson Paw.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.916
And surprised everyone

09:01.958 --> 09:03.376
by turning ourselves in.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.294
Yeah, we had a pretty good run
as bad guys,

09:05.336 --> 09:07.296
but sometimes you got
to give up the thing you know

09:07.338 --> 09:09.590
in order to find
something better.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.176
So here we are,
law-abiding citizens

09:12.218 --> 09:14.220
starting over
with a clean slate,

09:14.262 --> 09:19.600
and we cannot wait for society
to welcome us with open arms.

09:22.436 --> 09:26.065
And-and now you want to work,
uh, at-at a bank?

09:26.107 --> 09:28.693
Why not? Some of
my best memories are at banks.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.657
Uh, you robbed us three times.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.451
That was this bank?

09:37.493 --> 09:41.205
It says here that you saved the
city from an evil guinea pig,

09:41.247 --> 09:44.041
but aren't you
a notorious criminal?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.501
Yes. No.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.752
M-Maybe?

09:46.794 --> 09:48.254
Sor... Sorry, nerves.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.049
I-I mean, I-I can also do
a great tuna impression.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.218
It's like you're talking
to a tuna, right?

09:54.260 --> 09:57.179
Well, I'm proficient
in Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac

09:57.221 --> 09:59.348
and fluent
in 87 coding languages,

09:59.390 --> 10:01.267
so, yeah, I'm qualified.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.351
I see.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.728
And, um, how do you explain

10:03.769 --> 10:05.605
this gap
in your employment history?

10:05.646 --> 10:07.398
Uh...

10:07.440 --> 10:08.858
My salary expectations?

10:08.899 --> 10:10.860
Wow. That's a good question.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.237
No one's ever given me money
on purpose before.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.655
"Great at Secret Santa"?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.240
Yeah. How does that...

10:16.282 --> 10:18.284
W-W-Wait. Don't tell me.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.745
Bath bomb. Lavender.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.749
And how would you react if you
saw a coworker doing something

10:24.790 --> 10:27.084
that violates company policy?

10:27.126 --> 10:29.754
Snitches get stitches
and sleep with the fishes.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.047
You know what? Can I act--

10:31.088 --> 10:32.757
Can I get another chance
at that one?

10:33.758 --> 10:35.468
I think we got
everything we need.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.845
-So great to meet you.
-Thanks for coming in.

10:37.887 --> 10:41.807
Uh, we're gonna...
we're gonna pass.

10:41.849 --> 10:45.561
Uh, look, Craig,
anyone who wants to change

10:45.603 --> 10:47.438
needs to start somewhere, right?

10:47.480 --> 10:50.858
So I'm just asking for a chance.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.777
Just a chance.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.195
Please?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.740
You know what, Mr. Wolf?

10:57.782 --> 10:59.033
I might-- you know, I might,

10:59.075 --> 11:00.451
I might have
something here for you.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.786
I'm gonna give you a call.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.621
Gee. R-Really?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.539
Craig, that's great!

11:05.581 --> 11:07.458
Number's on my résumé there.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.252
-Okay. Uh...
-And this has been just great.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.671
-You can let go now.
-Sorry.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.963
I didn't mean to...

11:13.005 --> 11:15.883
I got a job!
This is fantastic, man.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.345
Oh, by the way, Craig,
uh, you know...

11:23.099 --> 11:24.308
Ah.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.018
Yeah. Got it.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.336
...to a better future.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.548
In three weeks, my next-gen
MoonX rocket will blast off

11:55.589 --> 11:57.883
and deploy the Power Cell X3.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.176
That's right.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.554
Free wireless charging
from outer space

12:01.595 --> 12:03.556
directly to your phone.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.683
-You're welcome, world.
-Hey, guys. -Hey! -Wolfie.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.476
Wolf! So you got the job?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.770
Well, I mean,
it's not a hundred percent,

12:09.812 --> 12:11.897
but he said,
he said he'd call me.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.233
Well, you did better
than Piranha.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.360
I thought I was supposed
to project confidence.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.987
Yeah, but why a tuna?

12:18.028 --> 12:19.405
What? Tunas are confident.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.365
What tuna do you know
that's not confident?

12:21.407 --> 12:22.450
All of them.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.034
-Tunas are confident.
-Right?

12:24.076 --> 12:26.203
Guys, come on.
Life's like a car chase.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.747
You know what I mean?
There's-there's gonna be

12:27.788 --> 12:30.207
bumps in the road, but
when has that ever stopped us?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.333
Never.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.127
It's just gonna take
a little time,

12:33.169 --> 12:35.504
but I promise you,
people will come around.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.424
Even if we get framed for the
Phantom Bandit's crime spree?

12:38.466 --> 12:39.717
That's awfully specific.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.844
Who's the Phantom, uh-- Who?

12:41.886 --> 12:44.180
You haven't heard?
It's all over the news.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.098
There's a battle
of survival for the bil--

12:46.140 --> 12:49.059
The Phantom Bandit hit
three locations yesterday,

12:49.101 --> 12:51.395
stealing several
priceless artifacts.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.940
The Phantom is known
for being impossible to trace,

12:54.982 --> 12:57.651
but this time,
he left a calling card.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.155
Wait, hey, hey!
That's our move.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.573
Exactly.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.825
Commissioner, are the Bad Guys
back to a life of crime,

13:04.867 --> 13:06.702
or are they being framed?

13:06.744 --> 13:09.538
Just like your face
with those fabulous bangs!

13:09.580 --> 13:11.081
Thank you. I cut them myself.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.584
Look, I cannot comment
on an ongoing investigation,

13:13.626 --> 13:17.379
but let's just say:
once a con, always a con.

13:17.421 --> 13:20.508
-So it's the Bad Guys?
-I said no comment!

13:20.549 --> 13:21.884
-Come on.
-What?

13:21.926 --> 13:23.427
How are we supposed
to get a fresh start

13:23.469 --> 13:24.887
when we get blamed for
every bad thing that happens?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.352
Hey, guys.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.979
Isn't the sun
particularly radiant today?

13:34.021 --> 13:36.774
-What are you wearing?
-What are you drinking?

13:36.816 --> 13:39.235
Wheatgrass kombucha
with extra moss

13:39.276 --> 13:42.238
and two shots
of cold-pressed dandelion.

13:42.279 --> 13:46.617
Uh, I don't think you're
supposed to eat those things.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.327
Aw, you guys.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.496
I wish I could trade
lighthearted japes

13:50.538 --> 13:53.499
with you all night,
but I'm late for vinyasa.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.793
-Vinyasa?
-W-W-Wait. You're going out?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.127
But y-you just got back.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.754
You know how it is.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.465
You think I got this body
by sitting around, watching TV?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.801
-Okay, ew.
-Oh, and don't wait up for me.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.386
It's lucha night.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.514
Well, bye...!

14:13.185 --> 14:15.646
Guys, I think
the kombucha ate his brain.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.650
Hey, you know what?
As long as he's happy, right?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.861
-And you're not?
-I'd be happier

14:21.902 --> 14:24.822
if I could land
one of these jobs.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.783
--First impressions
are hard to shake.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.868
Ooh, that was quick.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.120
I mean, when I first met you,

14:31.161 --> 14:34.373
I thought you were arrogant,
self-satisfied,

14:34.415 --> 14:35.833
dishonest...

14:36.876 --> 14:38.252
...greedy, for sure.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.338
Oh, yeah?
What changed your mind?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.506
What do you mean?

14:42.548 --> 14:45.092
Ha ha ha. Very funny.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.510
Seriously, it's hard

14:46.552 --> 14:48.178
to stay positive
when we keep getting rejected.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.848
It makes you feel--
I don't know-- hopeless.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.391
Mm.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.520
I mean, going good was the
hardest thing that I ever did.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.773
And compared to you guys,
I had it easy.

14:59.815 --> 15:03.235
No one ever knew
I was the Crimson Paw.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.529
I'm sorry,
did you say you were the

15:05.571 --> 15:07.281
Crimson Paw?!

15:08.490 --> 15:09.533
Sorry.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.535
I didn't quite catch that.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.040
Okay, you asked for it.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.375
You're about to discover
why they call me

15:18.417 --> 15:20.920
the Big Bad Wo--

15:26.467 --> 15:28.594
I think I got carried away.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.640
I don't think this is gonna
help my-- with my interviews.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.768
I don't know. I think it's cute.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.062
-Gives you character.
-Oh.

15:38.103 --> 15:42.441
Do I have a concussion, or is
the governor flirting with me?

15:42.483 --> 15:45.194
-Can't it be both?
-Hmm.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.988
-Uh, uh...
-Oh, uh...

15:48.030 --> 15:48.989
-Sorry, I shouldn't have...
-Oh, no, no, no.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.407
I-I didn't really, um...

15:50.449 --> 15:52.493
Uh, yeah, 'cause
you're the governor,

15:52.534 --> 15:54.036
-and I'm, you know.
-An-an ex-con.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.913
-Yeah.
-I know.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.122
It's optics.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.707
-Totally.
-Let's just...

15:58.749 --> 16:00.334
-Yeah, let's keep it friendly.
-...keep it friendly.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.087
-Medium friendly?
-Yeah.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.213
-Madam Governor.
-Oops.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.881
Madam Governor.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.884
Sorry to interrupt
you and your acquaintance...

16:08.926 --> 16:10.427
Finally, she remembers my name.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.054
...but you've got the
children's hospital fundraiser

16:12.096 --> 16:13.597
in 20 minutes.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.349
-I'll be right there, Maureen.
-Oh, good. Thank you.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.184
Another fundraiser?

16:17.226 --> 16:18.602
Oof, look at you.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.604
Same time next week?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.982
My calendar's wide open.

16:24.608 --> 16:25.901
Hey.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.321
I know it's tough,
but you can't lose hope, okay?

16:29.363 --> 16:31.323
People do want to trust you.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.076
You just have to give them
a reason.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.120
Promise?

16:36.161 --> 16:37.830
Governor's word.

16:37.871 --> 16:41.959
But until then, I would work
on that right hook.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.421
It feels a little like I'm
getting kissed by a butterfly.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.089
Catch you later, tough guy.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.716
I was holding back.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.772
Huh.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.941
"Give them a reason."

17:05.983 --> 17:08.193
No!

17:08.235 --> 17:09.987
I said no comment!

17:11.947 --> 17:13.449
I want answers.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.993
Get me security footage,
scour the phone logs,

17:16.035 --> 17:17.953
and where's my coffee?!

17:17.995 --> 17:19.371
-Uh, Commissioner?
-Not now!

17:19.413 --> 17:21.290
-But you have a visitor.
-They can wait.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.541
Uh, but he's, uh...

17:22.583 --> 17:23.459
Hey-hey, Chief!

17:23.500 --> 17:25.669
Can I just say:

17:25.711 --> 17:27.504
love the bangs.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.882
First off,
it's "Commissioner" now.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.133
And second...

17:31.175 --> 17:32.718
Ooh, nice.
What's the difference?

17:32.760 --> 17:35.387
Well, the chief is the top
uniformed officer, whereas--

17:35.429 --> 17:38.015
Why am I explaining this
to you?!

17:38.057 --> 17:40.350
Did you touch my board?

17:40.392 --> 17:43.103
-My board. My beautiful board.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.106
I thought I heard it say,
"Solve me."

17:46.148 --> 17:48.192
-Wolf.
-Listen.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.028
I think we're both having
an optics problem.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.488
You need to show the world

17:52.529 --> 17:54.239
you've got this investigation
under control,

17:54.281 --> 17:56.241
and we need
to show the world we're good.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.285
If I help you catch the Bandit,
it's a win-win.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.536
I'm calling the governor.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.122
Go ahead.
It was basically her idea.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.791
Look at this.

18:03.832 --> 18:07.044
Each of the robberies occurred
within a three-minute window.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.213
-So?
-Three minutes is the loop rate

18:09.254 --> 18:10.881
of most standard
security consoles,

18:10.923 --> 18:12.591
which means whoever did this...

18:12.633 --> 18:15.552
Patched into security
from the inside.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.887
Bingo.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.430
Fine.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.892
Let's say they did.
How would we even trace that?

18:21.934 --> 18:24.853
We'd need some kind of
high-tech computer expert.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.148
They'd have had to clone the IP
address and redirect the feed

18:28.190 --> 18:30.734
to a four gigahertz
dummy console, duh.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.819
Huh?

18:31.860 --> 18:33.570
Your Bandit is clever

18:33.612 --> 18:35.447
but not as clever
as he thinks he is.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.659
However, he'd still need
an inside man.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.411
Hmm.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.080
Hey.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.248
Hold this.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.875
Hmm.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.168
There!

18:49.336 --> 18:50.420
But that's just the janitor.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.464
Perhaps to the untrained eye,

18:52.506 --> 18:54.800
but if he's really
just the janitor,

18:54.842 --> 18:58.095
why is he pushing around
an empty bucket?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.888
Hmm?

18:59.930 --> 19:03.684
So the real question is:
How did he get in?

19:06.562 --> 19:08.397
I'd come this way, jam the fan,

19:08.438 --> 19:10.149
pop the grate,
and bam, you're in.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.442
Ooh, ugh.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.069
Why is there pickles in this?

19:14.111 --> 19:16.446
Because that's my lunch.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.198
Who said you could eat my lunch?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.449
Well, he said there was lunch.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.368
Chief, come on. Let's focus.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.412
So we know when and we know how.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.789
The real question is why.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.962
Well, why don't you call
some more people

19:32.004 --> 19:33.422
to barge in and help?

19:33.463 --> 19:34.798
Ooh!

19:36.300 --> 19:37.801
Welcome, friend,

19:37.843 --> 19:39.428
to Mr. Snake's voicemail.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.054
Today's advice for the soul:

19:41.096 --> 19:43.557
We must stop concentrating
on our differences

19:43.599 --> 19:47.019
and look for
what we have in common.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.770
-Namaste.
-Ugh.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.480
Bye...!

19:50.522 --> 19:52.608
Is he possessed?

19:52.649 --> 19:54.193
Ugh, don't even get me started.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.612
I mean, one day he's going
to yoga, he's doing pottery.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.405
I mean, who does pottery,
the cast of Ghost?

19:58.447 --> 19:59.948
Guys, guys, guys, guys. Hold on.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.491
-Huh?
-What'd he say again?

20:01.533 --> 20:04.536
"Look for what we have
in common."

20:05.329 --> 20:07.289
Look. It's not about
the artifacts.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.041
It's about
what they have in common.

20:09.082 --> 20:12.085
They're all made from a rare
metal called MacGuffinite.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.170
Of course.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.963
Uh, MacGuff-a-what, now?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.673
Um, sounds kind of made-up.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.134
So does the word "gold"
if you didn't know it was real.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.552
Say "gold."

20:20.594 --> 20:22.596
-Gold. Gold. -Gold. Gold.
-Gold. Gold. -Gold. Gold.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.264
-Gold.
-Gold. -Gold.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.891
That does sound made-up.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.644
Oh, now I can't stop thinking
how it sounds weird. Gold.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.646
So now that we know
what the Bandit is after...

20:30.687 --> 20:33.732
We can figure out
where he's gonna strike next!

20:33.774 --> 20:36.693
There you go.
That's the chief I know.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.737
Mmm. You grinding
your own beans these days?

20:38.779 --> 20:41.365
It's "Commissioner."

20:41.406 --> 20:42.950
Now get out of my office.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.994
Yeah!

20:46.036 --> 20:47.704
♪ Shake your groove thing ♪

20:47.746 --> 20:49.456
♪ Shake your groove thing,
yeah, yeah... ♪

20:50.999 --> 20:53.293
Next thing you know,
we're on TV getting medals.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.212
Naming streets after us.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.089
Piranha Street, baby.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.632
Hey, listen to this.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.176
Translated into English,
the word "MacGuffinite" means

21:01.218 --> 21:03.220
"a small MacGuffin." Cute.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.556
Okay. Not super helpful,
but, uh, what else you got?

21:06.598 --> 21:09.184
The most famous
MacGuffinite object is

21:09.226 --> 21:10.978
the Belt of Guatelamango.

21:11.019 --> 21:14.273
Did you say
the Belt of Guatelamango?

21:14.314 --> 21:16.566
-You heard of that?
-Heard of it?

21:16.608 --> 21:17.859
It's the championship trophy

21:17.901 --> 21:20.237
for the Lords of Lucha
tournament.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.655
Uh-oh.

21:21.697 --> 21:22.823
Wait, isn't that
where Snake is going tonight?

21:22.864 --> 21:24.283
That's right.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.827
Can you imagine him
at a wrestling match?

21:26.868 --> 21:29.204
-He hates crowds.
-And loud music.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.747
And flamboyant costumes.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.916
And things
that make life worthwhile.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.300
Oh, no.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.843
Ow!

21:46.805 --> 21:48.307
It's Snake!

21:48.348 --> 21:50.017
It's all right here.

21:50.058 --> 21:54.104
Happy hour. Pottery. Yoga.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.981
All the same times
as the Bandit's robberies.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.442
He's been lying to us
this whole time.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.485
Ooh, he's such a little snake.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.863
-That's why he's so happy.
-Oh.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.656
Vinyasa, my butt.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.908
If he gets caught,
he's going back to prison.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.453
We got to find him before
Police Chief cracks the case.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.747
Uh-oh.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.126
Hello?

22:16.168 --> 22:20.339
Guess who has two thumbs, bangs
and cracked the case?

22:20.380 --> 22:23.091
-This gal!
-Oh, really?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.843
It's going down tonight

22:24.885 --> 22:27.012
at the Lords of Lucha
tournament.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.723
I am gonna catch
that Bandit red-handed.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.600
I got to say, well done, Wolf.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.810
Well done.
You have exceeded my...

22:35.854 --> 22:39.066
-Bro, that was our only phone!
-What the thorax?

22:39.107 --> 22:40.817
I don't know. I panicked!

22:40.859 --> 22:43.195
Guys, there's only
one play here:

22:43.236 --> 22:44.363
find our friend and...

22:44.404 --> 22:46.656
Tear him apart limb by limb

22:46.698 --> 22:50.077
until all he can remember
is pain!

22:51.370 --> 22:53.080
Wow, okay.
I was gonna say save him,

22:53.121 --> 22:55.457
but, sure, if there's time,
we can do the limb thing.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.344
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:07.386 --> 23:09.096
put your hands together

23:09.137 --> 23:13.683
for the current
reigning world champion,

23:13.725 --> 23:18.146
Handsome Jorge!

23:18.188 --> 23:20.732
Ha ha! Yes!

23:21.525 --> 23:24.528
Face of an angel.
Punch of el diablo.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.821
Ha! Ha!

23:36.331 --> 23:37.666
Snake!

23:37.707 --> 23:40.877
I'm gonna kill you!

23:50.053 --> 23:51.138
Wow.

23:56.893 --> 24:00.439
And Mama said
I'd never get to heaven.

24:01.189 --> 24:03.150
Look at me now, Mama!

24:05.318 --> 24:07.904
I'm gonna need
a lot of mustard.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.823
Piranha, check it out.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.033
One in your size
and one in my size!

24:12.075 --> 24:13.410
Guys, we can shop later.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.078
Right now, we need to find
Snake. Let's go. Come on.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.538
Ooh. Right, right, right,
right, right.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.331
-It's just so much!
-Now, listen.

24:18.373 --> 24:19.833
He could be anywhere.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.543
Webs, search the upper deck.
I'll look ringside.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.878
-You two...
-Guys!

24:22.919 --> 24:24.880
I can't believe
you came all this way

24:24.921 --> 24:26.256
just to see me arrest the Band--

24:28.467 --> 24:29.926
-What? What was that?
-I don't know.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.429
I panicked, okay?
I'm a panicker.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.270
Okay, no more panicking.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.148
Webs, search the upper deck.
You two, backstage.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.984
Remember, we're dealing
with a master of deception

24:46.026 --> 24:48.570
who can move like water
and vanish like smoke.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.864
-He could be anywhere...
-There he is.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.075
-Snake!
-Huh?

24:56.453 --> 24:57.662
We know everything!

24:57.704 --> 24:59.247
What? How did you find out?

24:59.289 --> 25:00.832
Ow!

25:03.502 --> 25:04.669
Snakey Cakes?

25:04.711 --> 25:06.630
Huh?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.008
Uh...

25:10.050 --> 25:11.801
If I knew you were
expecting friends,

25:11.843 --> 25:13.220
I would've gotten more nachos.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.138
Because, well, I know
you don't like to share.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.056
That's true.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.308
-Unless it's kisses.
-Mmm.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.684
Then he likes to share,

25:19.726 --> 25:21.394
-don't you, Snakey Wakey?
-Oh, yeah.

25:27.567 --> 25:30.028
Guys, this is Susan.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.112
Hey.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.908
Is she your hostage?

25:34.950 --> 25:36.159
No!

25:36.201 --> 25:38.161
She's my girlfriend.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.085
She called him Snakey Cakes!

25:46.419 --> 25:49.965
Huh. So these are the roommates.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.341
Roommates?

25:51.383 --> 25:53.593
Did you say "roommates"?

25:53.635 --> 25:55.762
Hey, I'm pulling
your whiskers, Whiskers.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.181
Snakey here told me
all about you guys.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.767
Wait, wait. I'm-I'm just
trying to do the math here.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.603
You're with Snake on purpose?

26:05.230 --> 26:07.732
Well, you talk pretty tough
for a mango with teeth.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.819
What? Is that what I look like?

26:10.860 --> 26:13.196
Ooh, she is spicy. I like it.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.698
Insult me next.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.204
Are you ready to dance?

26:25.584 --> 26:29.129
Another victory
for Handsome Jorge!

26:29.170 --> 26:31.047
Jorge! Jorge!

26:31.089 --> 26:33.758
No one can defeat
my handsomeness.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.803
And now bring down

26:36.845 --> 26:40.807
the Belt of Guatelamango!

26:40.849 --> 26:42.350
Oh, my gosh! It's the belt!

26:42.392 --> 26:45.270
Give me the belt!
Give me that belt! I love it!

26:46.438 --> 26:48.231
Wait a minute. Fans...

26:51.484 --> 26:52.819
Can it be?

26:52.861 --> 26:56.239
Yes! It looks like
we have a new challenger!

26:59.242 --> 27:02.370
Someone has
a death wish big enough

27:02.412 --> 27:04.914
to take on Handsome Jorge!

27:04.956 --> 27:06.875
Jorge! Jorge!

27:06.916 --> 27:09.753
Jorge! Jorge! Jorge!

27:12.339 --> 27:13.673
Of course.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.925
What better way to steal
the belt than to win it?

27:15.967 --> 27:18.094
That's the Phantom Bandit!

27:19.429 --> 27:22.891
Ha ha.
So, you want that belt, huh?

27:22.932 --> 27:24.517
We got to expose him.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.227
How are we supposed to do that?

27:26.269 --> 27:27.646
We improvise.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.731
Well, come and get it, pig--

27:29.773 --> 27:31.775
Wow!

27:31.816 --> 27:33.610
He means business!

27:33.652 --> 27:34.611
Yeah!

27:34.653 --> 27:36.696
C-C-Can we talk about this?

27:41.785 --> 27:43.912
This is wrestling at its best!

27:43.953 --> 27:46.039
Not the face.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.380
I didn't really think
that through.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.965
Uh-oh.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.972
Huh?

28:04.474 --> 28:05.475
Whoo.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.980
You ever been deboned
by a chicken?

28:11.022 --> 28:14.776
Who's ready for some violence?!

28:16.820 --> 28:19.406
Violence!

28:19.447 --> 28:21.700
Violence! Yes!

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is no luchador.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.149
It's the Phantom Bandit.

29:38.151 --> 29:42.489
She came here to steal
the... the...

29:42.530 --> 29:43.990
belt?

29:44.032 --> 29:46.826
Good luck getting
out of this one, Bad Guys.

29:46.868 --> 29:47.869
Huh?

29:47.911 --> 29:49.412
-What?
-Huh?

29:49.454 --> 29:51.247
Uh-oh.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.250
-It's the Bad Guys!
-They're stealing the belt!

29:57.670 --> 29:58.922
Let's get them!

29:58.963 --> 30:00.965
Run!

30:05.178 --> 30:06.846
-Piranha, will you take off
the belt? -I can't get it off!

30:06.888 --> 30:08.431
-Take off the belt!
-I can't get it off!

30:10.225 --> 30:13.102
My belt! My belt! Get 'em!

30:19.484 --> 30:20.568
Chief.

30:20.610 --> 30:23.321
Chief, it's not
what it looks like!

30:24.489 --> 30:26.950
I... I trusted you.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.417
People! We've got a code 12!

30:36.459 --> 30:38.837
Bad Guys are the bandits!
Mobilize!

30:38.878 --> 30:40.547
Yes, ma'am.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.802
Uh-oh.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.971
-What do we do now?
-Wolf!

30:55.270 --> 30:56.145
Get in!

30:56.187 --> 30:57.856
You heard the bird. Get in!

31:01.901 --> 31:03.027
Go, go!

31:07.574 --> 31:10.451
Wow, that was close.

31:11.744 --> 31:15.415
Stop this truck now!

31:15.456 --> 31:17.125
Hold on, folks!

31:21.588 --> 31:23.256
Wolf!

31:23.298 --> 31:24.924
Sorry.

31:31.931 --> 31:34.642
Isn't she great?

31:34.684 --> 31:36.978
Bad Guys.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.523
I'm getting too old for this.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.192
All units. All units.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.361
Suspects are headed east
in a hot dog truck.

31:45.403 --> 31:46.988
Can you be more specific?

31:47.030 --> 31:49.782
Um, it looks to be all beef,
possibly chorizo.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.702
I need birds in the sky,
roadblocks every five miles.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.371
I want eyes on every motel,
greasy spoon,

31:55.413 --> 31:57.624
gas station, bus station,
cattle station, mole hole,

31:57.665 --> 32:00.668
vole hole and watering hole
within 80 miles.

32:00.710 --> 32:01.711
Let's go!

32:03.588 --> 32:05.381
Now it's personal.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.599
They fell for it.
Just like you planned, boss.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.726
Good. Let's go.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.081
Well, that went sideways.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.249
Susan, you were amazing.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.585
Where'd you learn
to drive like that?

32:42.627 --> 32:44.295
I used to deliver pizzas.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.923
Got canned for being too fast.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.841
Cool.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.386
-Your breath stinks.
-What?

32:51.427 --> 32:52.929
What do you brush
your teeth with, sardines?

32:52.971 --> 32:55.098
That's a burn.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.766
I don't brush my teeth
with anything.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.267
Shocking. Uh...

32:58.309 --> 33:00.061
That's kind of bad.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.604
I'm surprised
you hang out with me.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.481
-How about a mint?
-Ooh. That's clutch.

33:03.523 --> 33:06.275
-Yes, please.
-I'll take two.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.903
Uh, what about you, Wolf? Mint?

33:08.945 --> 33:10.196
I'm good. Thanks.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.948
So, how'd you guys meet anyway?

33:11.990 --> 33:14.200
Spill it. Spill it.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.619
-Okay, well, uh...
-Well...

33:16.661 --> 33:18.287
-You tell it. -No, no, no,
you tell it better.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.789
Yeah, but you do all the voices.

33:19.831 --> 33:20.957
And, like, you're so good at it.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.458
Can somebody tell it?!

33:22.500 --> 33:23.960
Okay, okay.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.170
It's a funny story.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.509
Hey, kid.

33:31.551 --> 33:32.927
Are you gonna eat that?

33:32.969 --> 33:33.970
What?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.930
♪ I think I could... ♪

33:35.972 --> 33:37.807
Hey.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.058
Um...

33:39.100 --> 33:40.393
Mix-up.

33:40.435 --> 33:44.480
♪ Crimson and clover. ♪

33:46.941 --> 33:48.735
Why is she in his mouth?

33:48.776 --> 33:50.319
Anyway, that's how we met.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.155
But-but that's nothing
compared to our first date

33:52.196 --> 33:53.239
-when we were...
-Ew, no! -Stop!

33:54.741 --> 33:56.451
All right, all right, all right.

33:56.492 --> 33:57.618
Got it.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.495
Love triumphs over all,
and that's great.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.456
But right now,
we need to focus on the fact

34:01.497 --> 34:04.751
that every cop in the state
thinks we're the Phantom Bandit.

34:04.792 --> 34:05.793
Hmm.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.420
Not much of a romantic, are you?

34:07.462 --> 34:10.298
Don't mind him, Sugar Beak.
He's a little touchy.

34:10.339 --> 34:13.176
Uh, he's been friend-zoned
by the governor.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.970
I have not been
friend-zoned by the...

34:16.012 --> 34:18.097
I need a phone.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.559
Madam Governor. Madam Governor.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.811
How soon are the Bad Guys
going back to prison?

34:23.853 --> 34:25.688
Please, let's not jump
to conclusions

34:25.730 --> 34:27.857
before we have all the facts.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.025
Thank you. That's all quest--

34:29.067 --> 34:30.443
That's all the questions
for now.

34:30.485 --> 34:31.778
All right, Diane.

34:31.819 --> 34:33.362
It's time to implement
damage control.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.864
I'm gonna tell the press
there's no more questions

34:34.906 --> 34:36.240
-for now, and if they have...
-Hang on, Maureen.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.867
Aunt Linda!

34:37.909 --> 34:40.953
What a pleasant surprise.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.538
Wolf, what were you thinking?

34:42.580 --> 34:44.499
Diane, listen.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.000
We hit a little bit of trouble.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.293
Oh. Which part?

34:47.335 --> 34:49.045
Assaulting
the police commissioner

34:49.087 --> 34:52.632
or stealing a priceless belt
in front of thousands of people?

34:52.673 --> 34:54.217
It's-it's not
what it looks like.

34:54.258 --> 34:56.344
Someone's setting us up.
You got to believe me.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.179
Of course I believe you.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.765
Well, you might be
the only one.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.226
Listen, we could really use
your help right now.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.394
Wolf, I can't
call off the cops.

35:05.436 --> 35:06.896
There's too much heat on you.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.356
I know. I know. I know. I know.

35:08.397 --> 35:09.690
If you could just give me
something to work with,

35:09.732 --> 35:12.276
a-a clue, a starting place,
something.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.237
All I know is,
it-it's got something to do

35:14.278 --> 35:16.030
with that MacGuffinite thing.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.741
-MacGuffinite? Really?
-Yeah.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.576
It's what the Bandit's
been after the whole time.

35:20.618 --> 35:23.287
I hate to drag you into this,
but it's our only lead.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.747
Can you look into it?

35:26.499 --> 35:29.418
Yeah, I know exactly who to ask.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.045
-You do?
-Listen to me.

35:31.087 --> 35:33.506
I need you to lay low until
I get to the bottom of this.

35:33.548 --> 35:37.468
In the meantime,
don't trust anyone.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.138
-And, Wolf...
-Yeah?

35:40.179 --> 35:42.265
We'll get through this, okay?

35:42.306 --> 35:44.892
I hope so.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.436
Hey. I owe you one.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.940
What are medium friends
for, huh?

35:52.817 --> 35:54.318
Yeah.

35:58.823 --> 35:59.824
Maureen?

35:59.866 --> 36:01.868
-Yes, ma'am?
-Cancel my appointments.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.369
You got it, ma'am.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.376
I've got to catch up
with an old friend.

36:20.845 --> 36:21.888
Good news, gang.

36:21.929 --> 36:23.598
Diane's gonna help us
clear our names.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.683
All we got to do is
lay low and...

36:32.523 --> 36:33.691
You.

36:33.733 --> 36:37.195
You should've taken
the mint, Whiskers.

36:37.236 --> 36:40.364
Hey! Hey.

36:41.282 --> 36:42.575
Hiya, boss.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.160
Yeah, the chickens
are in the broiler.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.663
Repeat, the chickens
are in the broiler.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.386
What? Where... where are we?

37:02.428 --> 37:04.722
What's happening?

37:10.061 --> 37:16.984
Once upon a time,
there was a big, bad wolf.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.904
Ooh, love that guy.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.073
What a character.

37:22.114 --> 37:25.368
He's the one
who challenges the status quo,

37:25.409 --> 37:27.078
who takes the big chance.

37:27.119 --> 37:31.666
Without him, shoot, I don't
even think we have a story.

37:31.707 --> 37:34.752
And they call him the villain.

37:34.794 --> 37:38.381
Hmm. Kind of backwards,
don't you think?

37:38.422 --> 37:39.590
Do I know you?

37:39.632 --> 37:42.385
They call me
the Phantom Bandit.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.262
Nice ring to it, I guess.

37:44.303 --> 37:48.099
But you can call me Kitty Kat.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.017
I think you met my girls.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.769
-Hello!
-Holy shrimp.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.145
I'm Pigtail.

37:53.187 --> 37:55.564
It was great honor
to kick the butts of my heroes.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.401
The butts were even greater
than my dreams.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.444
She's a huge fan.

38:00.486 --> 38:01.904
Big crime nerd.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.823
Thanks.

38:03.864 --> 38:05.449
I think.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.452
Oh, hey, Susan!

38:08.494 --> 38:09.912
Actually...

38:09.954 --> 38:11.414
Hey!

38:12.248 --> 38:14.542
-It's Doom.
-Uh...

38:14.583 --> 38:17.128
Susan is an alias.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.589
-You lied to me.
-That's all right, papito.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.300
-Played me.
-Not cool, man.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.427
-Betrayed me.
-Hey. Hey, listen.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.262
-It's just business.
-You're...

38:26.304 --> 38:27.680
-Shady.
-You're...

38:27.722 --> 38:28.597
Shady.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.224
Let it out, buddy.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.184
You're the perfect woman!

38:34.020 --> 38:36.397
She out-snaked a snake!

38:36.439 --> 38:38.482
If that's not true love, well...

38:38.524 --> 38:41.402
well, then I don't know
what true love is.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.114
Snake...

38:45.156 --> 38:49.285
Okay. Kitty, y-you mind telling
us what we're doing here?

38:49.327 --> 38:52.288
Cutting to the chase. I like it.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.623
We're planning something big.

38:54.665 --> 38:58.336
Only problem: It's too big
for the three of us.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.796
You need work.
We need extra hands.

39:00.838 --> 39:05.301
Professionals, you know?
With a specific set of skills.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.929
One last job.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.348
Whatcha say?

39:10.389 --> 39:11.515
What do we say?

39:11.557 --> 39:13.267
No, uh, is the short answer.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.518
But, well, we're flattered.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.686
But, uh, the thing is,
you know...

39:15.728 --> 39:16.812
-We're good now.
-Yeah.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.606
We don't steal stuff anymore.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.316
Yeah, so if you can just,
you know, untie us,

39:20.358 --> 39:21.776
and, uh,
we'll let ourselves out.

39:21.817 --> 39:24.362
And we can just call it
a noche, okay?

39:40.461 --> 39:41.837
You know what?

39:41.879 --> 39:45.174
I love the red ones.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.510
Is it cherry?

39:47.551 --> 39:49.387
Is it strawberry?
I'm not really sure.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.847
I can never tell.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.767
It's kind of like people,
you know?

39:54.809 --> 39:57.645
You think they're one thing,

39:57.686 --> 40:01.982
but it turns out
they're something else entirely.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.195
Diane.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.530
She knows.

40:07.571 --> 40:10.950
Can you imagine if this got out?

40:10.991 --> 40:14.120
The governor's secret past
as the Crimson Paw?

40:14.161 --> 40:16.539
Whew. Talk about a scandal.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.792
She will be
in the hot bubble water.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.753
So...

40:24.505 --> 40:27.675
Let me rephrase the question.

40:27.716 --> 40:32.888
Play along,
and Diane's secret is safe.

40:32.930 --> 40:38.561
Or don't, and you, Diane,
the good life,

40:38.602 --> 40:43.149
it all comes crashing down.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.900
What'll it be?

40:50.281 --> 40:53.200
All right, hot sauce.
What's the job?

41:00.708 --> 41:03.586
That's the job.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.004
Whoa.

41:05.045 --> 41:06.589
Wow.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.550
That's the MoonX rocket.

41:15.681 --> 41:16.932
Seriously?

41:16.974 --> 41:18.601
You better believe it, girl.

41:18.642 --> 41:21.604
Why steal a car when you can
steal a big, jumbo rocket ship?

41:21.645 --> 41:23.147
I think she's serious.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.024
Why would you want
to steal a rocket?

41:25.065 --> 41:27.776
A heist is never
just about the loot.

41:27.818 --> 41:29.737
Isn't that right, Wolf?

41:29.778 --> 41:32.031
-It's a power move.
-Exactly.

41:32.072 --> 41:33.616
You get it.

41:33.657 --> 41:35.284
He gets it.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.912
All right, now, come on.
We got work to do.

41:38.662 --> 41:39.955
And after that,
we're square, right?

41:39.997 --> 41:41.790
You're gonna give us the video?

41:41.832 --> 41:43.667
Thieves' honor.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.003
This is gonna be gnarly.

41:46.045 --> 41:47.296
In the good way.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.964
Come on, y'all.
We're going on a heist.

41:49.006 --> 41:52.760
So, are we bad again, or...?

41:52.801 --> 41:54.178
You got to hand it to them.

41:54.220 --> 41:56.347
They thought of
almost everything.

41:56.388 --> 41:59.767
Almost? Oh, you got an angle.

41:59.808 --> 42:02.311
I've always got an angle.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.313
One last job, and after that,

42:04.355 --> 42:07.858
Little Miss Lollipop's
gonna regret she ever met us.

42:16.242 --> 42:17.493
Madam Governor?

42:17.535 --> 42:20.162
Take me to his cell.

42:28.420 --> 42:31.382
Well, well, well.

42:31.423 --> 42:33.092
Hello, Diane.

42:33.133 --> 42:34.843
Marmalade.

42:34.885 --> 42:40.224
Of all the super maximum prisons
in all the world,

42:40.266 --> 42:42.351
you had to walk into mine.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.894
Oh, my.

42:43.936 --> 42:45.437
You look like a balloon animal.

42:45.479 --> 42:47.481
I know, right?

42:47.523 --> 42:48.774
Today was arm day.

42:48.816 --> 42:51.151
That's why I'm looking
extra swole.

42:52.152 --> 42:55.364
So, to what do I owe the visit?

42:55.406 --> 42:57.324
I wonder if it has
anything to do with

42:57.366 --> 43:00.369
your mangy protégés fleeing
the scene of a crime.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.413
How do you know about that?

43:02.454 --> 43:04.081
It's my job to know.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.584
I'm the editor in chief
of the Crazy Max Chronicle.

43:06.625 --> 43:09.211
I also do yearbook, and I'm
captain of the pickleball team.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.088
To be honest, I'm kind of
crushing it in here.

43:11.130 --> 43:12.673
All right, well, good for you.

43:12.715 --> 43:15.551
But what do you know
about MacGuffinite?

43:15.593 --> 43:17.386
Oh.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.263
MacGuffinium Fictitium.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.058
Fascinating metal.

43:23.100 --> 43:26.103
With one extremely
unique property.

43:27.855 --> 43:29.690
And that is?

43:29.732 --> 43:31.400
Well, I'm not
just gonna tell you, am I?

43:31.442 --> 43:32.693
Did you forget?

43:32.735 --> 43:34.820
I'm sitting in prison
for your crimes.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.114
So what's in it for me?

43:37.156 --> 43:39.742
I am not giving you a pardon.

43:39.783 --> 43:41.285
A pardon?

43:41.327 --> 43:43.287
In the middle
of pickleball season?

43:43.329 --> 43:46.040
No. I have a better idea.

43:46.790 --> 43:50.377
How would you like
to play a game?

43:50.419 --> 43:52.963
What sort of sick game
do you want me to...

43:54.298 --> 43:56.175
Backstabbing governors first.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.220
Oh, goody.

44:02.848 --> 44:04.683
All right, everyone, listen up.

44:04.725 --> 44:08.604
Each of you has
a specific part to play.

44:12.066 --> 44:14.401
Safecracking gear!

44:14.443 --> 44:16.028
Disguises!

44:16.070 --> 44:17.446
Welcome, Ms. Tarantula.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.615
Whoa, that is some serious tech.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.116
Uh, I think
I got the wrong bag.

44:21.158 --> 44:23.035
Yeah, this doesn't seem like
proper attire

44:23.077 --> 44:24.912
to infiltrate a launch site.

44:24.953 --> 44:26.205
Oh, no.

44:26.246 --> 44:27.956
We're not going
to the launch site.

44:27.998 --> 44:30.292
We found a way to circumvent
every level of security

44:30.334 --> 44:31.460
leading to the rocket,

44:31.502 --> 44:33.712
and it's right there
on Mr. Moon's wrist.

44:33.754 --> 44:35.422
Watch controls everything,

44:35.464 --> 44:38.967
from front gate
to mission control

44:39.009 --> 44:41.428
to blastoff.

44:42.846 --> 44:45.933
Steal the watch,
steal the rocket.

44:45.974 --> 44:48.143
Only problem?
He never takes it off.

44:48.185 --> 44:50.396
Lucky we have
world-famous pickpocket.

44:50.437 --> 44:52.356
And we think
there's a window.

44:52.398 --> 44:54.942
"Jeremiah Moon invites you
to his exclusive,

44:54.983 --> 44:56.318
state-of-the-art wedding."

44:56.360 --> 44:58.320
Are you serious?
We're gonna crash the wedding?

44:58.362 --> 45:00.739
Oh, I love weddings!

45:00.781 --> 45:03.075
I mean, you know--
I li--

45:03.117 --> 45:05.828
I mean, I like them.
They're fine. I don't care.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.621
Whatever. No one cares.

45:07.663 --> 45:10.541
Um... here's how it's gonna go.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.837
This is a highly
exclusive event,

45:14.878 --> 45:16.964
and it's got protection
to match.

45:17.005 --> 45:19.425
So, we'll have to get creative.

45:20.843 --> 45:22.052
I'm a little rusty,
but I promise

45:22.094 --> 45:23.971
to play you respectfully.

45:24.012 --> 45:25.514
Mamma mia!

45:25.556 --> 45:26.807
Where's-a my flowers?

45:26.849 --> 45:29.560
Prego! Cappuccino! Extra grande!

45:29.601 --> 45:31.687
Tutti frutti! Limoncello!

45:31.729 --> 45:33.731
Oh, the veil? It's vintage.

45:33.772 --> 45:36.024
A princess wore it.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.818
Yoo-hoo!

45:37.860 --> 45:39.737
Jeremiah! Oh, there you are.

45:39.778 --> 45:41.196
Moon wears a pair of

45:41.238 --> 45:42.281
AR-enhancement glasses
that identify

45:42.322 --> 45:43.782
the people worth talking to.

45:43.824 --> 45:45.868
And the people who aren't.

45:45.909 --> 45:47.953
But-but I'm his aunt!

45:47.995 --> 45:49.580
Those who make the grade earn

45:49.621 --> 45:52.040
-a 60-second one-on-one
with Mr. Moon. -Jeremiah.

45:52.082 --> 45:53.500
That's our window.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.877
Our only window.

45:54.918 --> 45:56.920
Once the ceremony begins,

45:56.962 --> 45:59.173
it's over.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.384
All right, everyone. I got eyes.

46:02.426 --> 46:03.218
Piranha, you're a go.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.345
-Hey, Clarence.
-Huh?

46:05.387 --> 46:07.181
Something doesn't look right
in this trunk.

46:07.222 --> 46:10.058
Oh? What is it?
L-L-Let's see here.

46:10.100 --> 46:11.643
Oh, it's there.
It's there. Way in the back.

46:11.685 --> 46:13.812
-Uh, I don't see
anything. -Yeah. No, no, no.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.606
I think if you put
your head in there.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.942
Oh, Clarence.

46:20.027 --> 46:21.779
All clear here.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.324
Titanium triple spring release.

46:25.365 --> 46:27.576
I've missed you, my old friend.

46:30.037 --> 46:32.623
You're sure you still got this,
Snakey Cakes?

46:32.664 --> 46:33.749
Please.

46:33.791 --> 46:36.710
Lock picking is like a romance.

46:36.752 --> 46:39.087
You got to start
gentle, playful,

46:39.129 --> 46:42.174
work your way into
its little cold heart,

46:42.216 --> 46:46.762
until all those defenses
melt away.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.013
Oh. Sounds kind of fun.

46:51.183 --> 46:53.310
Are we still talking
about the lock?

46:55.646 --> 46:57.773
Huh?

46:57.815 --> 46:59.107
A power outage?

46:59.149 --> 47:01.735
Hello.
Extremely quick electrician.

47:01.777 --> 47:03.946
Did someone call
for an electrician?

47:03.987 --> 47:04.947
Yes, sir. That was me.

47:04.988 --> 47:06.615
-She's all clear.
-Oops.

47:06.657 --> 47:09.451
Don't worry. I fix and be out
of your lip hair in no time.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.829
All right, girls. Have fun.

47:14.331 --> 47:16.542
Name's Webs.
I'll be your hacker today.

47:19.002 --> 47:20.879
Mr. Wolf, that's your cue.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.972
Don't spend
it all in one place, you hear?

47:30.013 --> 47:31.932
That's my job.

47:33.851 --> 47:36.687
Hey. Afternoon. Howdy, ma'am.

47:36.728 --> 47:37.771
Eyes up, cowboy.

47:37.813 --> 47:40.023
Your target's at twelve o'clock.

47:40.065 --> 47:41.525
That's our man.

47:45.320 --> 47:47.865
What are you doing? Get in line.

47:47.906 --> 47:49.449
Buck Wolford doesn't do lines.

47:49.491 --> 47:51.326
Webs, how's my cover ID?

47:51.368 --> 47:52.661
-Hang tight, Wolfie. Just a
couple more firewalls. -Great.

47:52.703 --> 47:54.162
Relax, Kitty, I got this.

47:54.204 --> 47:55.372
-Wolf?
-Hey, excuse me.

47:55.414 --> 47:57.165
-Mr. Moon, sir.
-Hey.

47:57.207 --> 47:58.333
Come on. Come on. Come on.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.460
-Wolf!
-Bypass and boom!

48:03.171 --> 48:04.631
Careful, careful.

48:04.673 --> 48:07.009
Let's show our wealthy
and influential friend

48:07.050 --> 48:08.635
-a little respect.
-I thank you kindly.

48:08.677 --> 48:10.846
You still got it.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.683
Now this is it.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.143
Swap the watch for the dummy.

48:16.184 --> 48:18.312
Well, at least somebody's
civilized around here.

48:18.353 --> 48:20.355
My name's Buck Wolford.
Big Bad Oil.

48:20.397 --> 48:23.150
But I'm sure you heard of me.
I am just so...

48:23.191 --> 48:24.443
Need a hand?

48:24.484 --> 48:26.361
Last I checked,
you didn't have any.

48:26.403 --> 48:28.238
You never minded before.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.907
Ow!

48:29.948 --> 48:31.283
-Is she okay?
-Whoops.

48:31.325 --> 48:32.451
Oh, boy.

48:32.492 --> 48:34.536
Unless I'm mistaken,
rockets do need oil.

48:34.578 --> 48:35.495
How'd you feel about

48:35.537 --> 48:37.414
a strategic partnership,
Mr. Moon?

48:37.456 --> 48:39.541
You're coming to me
with a business proposal

48:39.583 --> 48:42.210
right before my wedding?

48:42.252 --> 48:44.713
You're a real operator,
Mr. Wolford.

48:46.006 --> 48:48.091
You don't know the half of it.

48:54.181 --> 48:57.309
Who authorized you
to make eye contact?

49:02.272 --> 49:03.398
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

49:03.440 --> 49:04.483
Mr. Wolford?

49:04.524 --> 49:06.068
-Uh...
-Get the watch!

49:06.109 --> 49:07.569
-Moon!
-Ah!

49:07.611 --> 49:09.905
There's my Soli-wolly.
You're looking extra bald.

49:09.947 --> 49:11.198
And you're looking short.

49:12.449 --> 49:14.284
Wolf.

49:15.869 --> 49:17.412
Have we met before?

49:17.454 --> 49:19.623
Uh, no, no. I guess I just have
one of those faces.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.667
Hey, anyway, Mr. Moon, uh...

49:21.708 --> 49:23.293
Did you take
a pottery class in Sydney?

49:23.335 --> 49:24.586
-Uh...
-Sir, it's time.

49:24.628 --> 49:26.171
Ah, yes. Showtime.

49:26.213 --> 49:27.589
Wait a minute.
Excuse me, Mr.--

49:27.631 --> 49:29.925
Can I just, uh-- Mr. Moon...

49:29.967 --> 49:32.052
No, habibi, listen.
I never forget a face.

49:32.094 --> 49:34.221
I-- Naked high diving!
Was it that?

49:34.262 --> 49:35.722
Oh, hi, yes.

49:35.764 --> 49:38.266
Can I borrow him for
just a moment?

49:38.308 --> 49:40.102
-No. Okay.
-Thank you kindly.

49:41.436 --> 49:42.729
You blew the heist!

49:42.771 --> 49:44.439
That guy, I-I-I knew him,

49:44.481 --> 49:45.983
and he was, he was gonna
recognize me.

49:46.024 --> 49:48.402
Bellissima. Bellissima?

49:48.443 --> 49:49.945
Uh, we got a slight problem.

49:49.987 --> 49:54.074
Someone needs to tell Marco
that a shark ate him.

49:54.116 --> 49:56.660
Are you guys trying
to sabotage this?

49:56.702 --> 49:58.537
Who's ready to get married?

50:01.999 --> 50:03.917
-Shark!
-I'm a panicker.

50:03.959 --> 50:05.127
This is all too much. You happy?

50:05.168 --> 50:06.545
I like this one.

50:06.586 --> 50:09.297
This whole thing's a bust!

50:09.339 --> 50:11.550
You lost your edge.

50:11.591 --> 50:13.135
And now the governor's
gonna pay for it.

50:13.176 --> 50:14.469
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:14.511 --> 50:15.971
Hey, let's not do
anything crazy, okay?

50:16.013 --> 50:17.014
We'll get you the watch.

50:17.055 --> 50:18.724
Oh, yeah?

50:18.765 --> 50:20.183
How?

50:31.194 --> 50:34.031
It's like a freakin' fairy tale.

50:42.581 --> 50:45.375
Honey, you look so beautiful
in this dress.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.382
Hmm.

50:55.260 --> 50:56.595
"Big Bad Wolf"?

50:56.636 --> 51:00.015
Hmm. Hmm.

51:00.057 --> 51:02.559
Shark, you're up.

51:11.777 --> 51:13.403
Welcome!

51:13.445 --> 51:18.033
Welcome to this most
beautifious, majestacular,

51:18.075 --> 51:19.868
incredimonious occasion.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.870
Whoo!

51:21.912 --> 51:24.372
Whoo! Whoo!

51:24.414 --> 51:26.792
-Could he be a little more
subtle? -Whoo!

51:26.833 --> 51:28.752
-For Shark, this is subtle.
-Whoo!

51:28.794 --> 51:30.128
Give it to me real good.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.923
We stand here today
to marry this man--

51:32.964 --> 51:35.050
this manly, masculine,

51:35.092 --> 51:38.053
manleously maleful man--

51:38.095 --> 51:40.388
and this totally normal woman

51:40.430 --> 51:43.391
-in the sacra-nimonius bonds...
-What? Wait a minute.

51:43.433 --> 51:45.143
...of holy matriminimamony.

51:45.185 --> 51:46.144
Whoo!

51:47.437 --> 51:49.731
Now, would you please
join hands.

51:49.773 --> 51:51.858
Hmm. Uh...

51:56.238 --> 51:57.864
That's him!

51:57.906 --> 52:00.700
Yep. Just-just join those hands.

52:00.742 --> 52:02.911
-Look. Look.
-No need to look at them.

52:02.953 --> 52:04.412
-Come on. Come on. Come on.
-Just blindly join

52:04.454 --> 52:07.165
-those hands together.
-I object!

52:07.207 --> 52:08.500
What?!

52:08.542 --> 52:09.876
Honey-bunny.

52:12.129 --> 52:13.505
Soliman, who do you think
you are?

52:13.547 --> 52:15.757
Moon, look what
you are marrying!

52:15.799 --> 52:18.593
It's none other than
the Big Bad Wolf!

52:20.512 --> 52:23.306
Here comes the bride.

52:23.348 --> 52:25.600
-Boop.
-How could this be?

52:25.642 --> 52:27.185
-He was here!
-Soli-wolly, this is a disgrace.

52:27.227 --> 52:28.770
-There were claws! I saw claws!
-Get him out of here now!

52:28.812 --> 52:30.522
Where are you taking me?!
There are witnesses!

52:30.564 --> 52:32.023
-We all saw it! You!
-Huh?

52:32.065 --> 52:34.025
-Don't just stand there!
-Hey, where's the officiant?

52:34.067 --> 52:36.236
Ooh, who cares?

52:43.827 --> 52:47.622
Definitely top five
Bad Guys heist ever!

52:48.540 --> 52:51.459
When big man say, "I object,"

52:51.501 --> 52:53.587
I almost make pee-pee accident!

52:55.380 --> 52:56.798
Right.

52:56.840 --> 52:58.133
Almost.

52:59.217 --> 53:00.635
Wolf, I-I got to ask.

53:00.677 --> 53:02.512
How'd you know
that was gonna work?

53:02.554 --> 53:06.099
You see, Kitty, there's
three parts to every con.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.855
First, bait the hook.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.239
Look.

53:21.281 --> 53:22.449
Then comes the turn.

53:22.490 --> 53:23.909
Something weird is going on.

53:23.950 --> 53:26.328
-Someone should object.
-I object!

53:26.369 --> 53:27.996
-But none of it works
without the payoff. -What?!

53:28.038 --> 53:30.040
'Cause it's one thing

53:30.081 --> 53:31.541
to steal the watch...

53:31.583 --> 53:33.251
Soliman, who do you
think you are?

53:33.293 --> 53:35.378
Hold on tight, bellissima.

53:37.214 --> 53:39.966
...and another
to get away with it.

53:40.008 --> 53:43.178
The Big Bad Wolf!

53:43.220 --> 53:45.805
The art of misdirection.

53:45.847 --> 53:48.767
It's not the action,
it's the distraction. Got it.

53:48.808 --> 53:50.352
Yes, ma'am.

53:50.393 --> 53:51.645
Hey!

53:51.686 --> 53:54.189
All right, I see you.

53:54.231 --> 53:56.608
Oh, I love weddings!

53:56.650 --> 53:57.901
All right!

54:04.658 --> 54:06.034
Hmm.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.995
No. Not there.

54:09.037 --> 54:11.831
No. Maybe...

54:11.873 --> 54:13.541
-Oh, so many options.
-Oh, my goodness.

54:13.583 --> 54:16.336
Can we move this along?

54:16.378 --> 54:17.545
Patience, Diane.

54:17.587 --> 54:18.922
This is a game
of subtle strategy

54:18.964 --> 54:21.174
and psychological endurance
mastered only by

54:21.216 --> 54:23.885
the most cunning
and sophisticated minds.

54:23.927 --> 54:26.805
"Ages six and up."

54:26.846 --> 54:29.891
Besides, it's not
every day that the governor

54:29.933 --> 54:32.811
drops by to chat about
quantum ferromagnetism.

54:34.104 --> 54:38.900
Quantu-- Wait, are you saying
MacGuffinite is magnetic?

54:40.110 --> 54:41.569
Not just a magnet.

54:41.611 --> 54:44.489
MacGuffinite is
the atomic inverse of gold.

54:44.531 --> 54:46.741
Exposed to extreme voltage...

54:46.783 --> 54:48.660
It will cause gold electrons
to decouple

54:48.702 --> 54:50.578
and attract
with spectacular force.

54:50.620 --> 54:52.247
It's a gold magnet.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.249
Oh, she's catching on.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.751
Very good.

54:56.793 --> 55:00.922
Why rob a bank when you can
make the gold come to you?

55:00.964 --> 55:04.592
All the crime,
none of the exercise.

55:05.302 --> 55:07.470
-Uh, thanks, Professor.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:07.512 --> 55:10.432
You can't go.
We haven't finished our...

55:10.473 --> 55:13.018
What? No! But how?!

55:13.059 --> 55:15.020
It's literally tic-tac-toe.

55:15.061 --> 55:16.980
Send me your yearbook?

55:18.148 --> 55:19.816
You know, it's funny.

55:19.858 --> 55:22.652
You're the second person
to come all the way here

55:22.694 --> 55:24.571
to ask me about MacGuffinite.

55:27.574 --> 55:28.950
What are the odds?

55:28.992 --> 55:31.661
You had a visitor?

55:31.703 --> 55:33.079
I didn't get her name,

55:33.121 --> 55:36.082
but apparently we have
a friend in common.

55:36.124 --> 55:39.252
Or should I say... five?

55:47.302 --> 55:49.012
Madam Governor.

55:49.054 --> 55:53.016
I need footage of Marmalade's
last visitor. Now.

56:10.909 --> 56:12.369
Found ya.

56:25.215 --> 56:27.384
-But can I drive?
-No.

56:27.425 --> 56:29.886
This was
new best day of my life.

56:30.970 --> 56:33.181
-Why must you leave forever?
-Aw.

56:33.223 --> 56:36.351
-Cheer up, Buttersnout.
-Buttersnout?

56:36.393 --> 56:38.228
-I always wanted a nickname.
-Oh.

56:38.269 --> 56:39.604
Uh, great.

56:41.231 --> 56:43.817
Hey, listen, uh, no hard
feelings about the whole,

56:43.858 --> 56:45.151
you know, pretend relationship

56:45.193 --> 56:46.861
to entrap you
and your buddies, okay?

56:46.903 --> 56:48.029
Oh.

56:48.071 --> 56:49.781
Come on, now. Of course not.

56:49.823 --> 56:52.158
I mean, to be honest,
I-I wasn't, uh,

56:52.200 --> 56:53.535
really that into you.

56:53.576 --> 56:54.911
Oh, weird.

56:54.953 --> 56:58.373
'Cause you, uh,
you seemed pretty into me.

56:58.415 --> 56:59.541
Well, that's...

56:59.582 --> 57:01.209
Yeah?

57:01.251 --> 57:03.253
That-- You know, I didn't
want to hurt your feelings,

57:03.294 --> 57:05.672
so, uh, yeah,
sorry if you're disappointed.

57:05.713 --> 57:07.715
Oh, no, no, no, no, not me.

57:07.757 --> 57:10.844
You see, uh, I'd only be
disappointed if I was into you,

57:10.885 --> 57:15.598
which, uh, as previously
established, I was not, okay?

57:15.640 --> 57:16.850
Of course.

57:16.891 --> 57:18.893
Otherwise,
this marshmallow toast

57:18.935 --> 57:21.479
would be
full of romantic tension.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.106
Hmm.

57:23.898 --> 57:26.734
Yeah. Of course I did.

57:26.776 --> 57:28.111
Oh, really?

57:28.153 --> 57:31.406
So impersonating the bride
was your idea?

57:31.448 --> 57:32.907
-Absolutely.
-Yeah. Okay.

57:32.949 --> 57:34.617
I hired you.

57:34.659 --> 57:37.203
Therefore, your ideas
are my ideas.

57:37.245 --> 57:38.538
Classy.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.664
What's going on
with the MacGuffinite?

57:39.706 --> 57:41.749
Oh, just a little
science project.

57:41.791 --> 57:44.586
Ah. So you framed us
for science?

57:44.627 --> 57:47.839
Come on, I had to frame you.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.508
It was the only way
to draw you out of retirement.

57:51.968 --> 57:54.888
Anyway, you got
what you wanted, so, uh...

57:56.347 --> 57:58.141
Oh. Oh!

57:58.183 --> 58:01.478
Right. You want the video.

58:02.979 --> 58:05.398
There we go.

58:05.440 --> 58:06.900
-Ooh.
-Oh, man.

58:06.941 --> 58:09.777
Did... did I ever tell you
about my first heist?

58:09.819 --> 58:11.112
Uh, no.

58:11.154 --> 58:13.865
-Um, was it a bank?
-Jewelry store?

58:13.907 --> 58:16.451
Lollipop.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.453
Back in school, we had a teacher

58:18.495 --> 58:21.706
who used to give
the good kids a lollipop.

58:21.748 --> 58:24.709
And maybe it was
my claws or my teeth,

58:24.751 --> 58:28.004
but she never, ever
looked my way.

58:28.046 --> 58:29.714
It was hurtful.

58:29.756 --> 58:32.425
So one day, when the old fart
wasn't looking,

58:32.467 --> 58:36.429
I snuck into the drawer
and swiped the whole bag.

58:36.471 --> 58:38.640
After that,

58:38.681 --> 58:42.810
when the kids wanted lollipops,
they came to me.

58:42.852 --> 58:44.938
Dude, it was amazing, man.

58:44.979 --> 58:49.025
For the first time in my life,
I felt powerful.

58:49.817 --> 58:52.445
I must've pulled off
a hundred jobs since then.

58:52.487 --> 58:57.158
And the more you steal,
the more they respect you.

58:57.200 --> 58:59.369
Hmm.

58:59.410 --> 59:01.663
Why would you give that up?

59:03.206 --> 59:08.336
You think if you play nice
and follow their rules,

59:08.378 --> 59:12.840
they'll just see you
for who you truly are.

59:12.882 --> 59:16.219
But let me tell you, they won't.

59:16.261 --> 59:19.931
What if the bad life
was your best life?

59:20.890 --> 59:23.184
My advice:

59:23.226 --> 59:27.939
Stop hoping
and enjoy the lollipop.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.377
-Did you get it?
-Oh, we got it.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.963
Come on, I had to frame you.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.715
It was the only way
to draw you out--

59:53.756 --> 59:55.216
Full confession.

59:55.258 --> 59:56.801
I can't believe
she didn't notice the camera.

59:56.843 --> 59:58.261
All we need to do is get this

59:58.303 --> 01:00:00.054
-to the chief and clear
our names. -All right.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.389
-We did it. We did it.
-Whoo! Yeah!

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:04.017
-Woo-hoo!
-Touchdown dance!

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:08.146
Hey, buddy.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:09.647
You okay?

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.566
Huh?

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.568
Oh. Uh, nothing.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.445
Just, uh,
imagining my next round

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:17.780
of thrilling job interviews.

01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:19.741
Wolfie, this is the plan.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:22.160
Yeah. No, I know.
I'm just saying...

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.579
What am I saying?

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.748
I'm just saying, wh--
what if we took a wrong turn

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.375
with the whole going good thing?

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:30.627
You know what I mean?

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:34.464
Yeah, but it's gonna be
different this time.

01:00:34.505 --> 01:00:36.799
"Captured the Phantom Bandit."

01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:38.134
That'll look great
on your résumé.

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:40.803
We're gonna be heroes.
Piranha Street.

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:43.097
Yeah, no, yeah. Totally.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.142
What am I talking about?
You're right.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:47.935
Come on, let's find the chief.

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.604
-Let's go.
-That's my Wolf.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.443
Uh-oh.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.738
Did you really think
it was gonna be that easy?

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.615
Shoot.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.200
-Hey!
-Watch it!

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:04.369
Naughty, naughty.

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:05.953
Are these gold?

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:09.290
Kitty, can we talk about this
for a second? Uh...

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.875
Nope.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.672
Is that MacGuffinite?

01:01:15.713 --> 01:01:16.798
What's going on?

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:19.592
How about I show you?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.181
Ooh, shiny.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:28.309
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:35.817
A gold magnet?

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.985
You bet your scaly butt it is.

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:40.154
And this is just a prototype.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:42.740
Wait till you see
what it can do in zero gravity.

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:45.034
-You're taking it to space?
-Obviously.

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:46.744
What do you think
giant rocket is for?

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.663
Is not for science fair.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.331
You can't expect us to steal

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.166
all the world's gold
from down here.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:55.420
The biggest heist in history.

01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:56.921
Courtesy of us.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:58.339
All the world's gold?

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.342
Oh. Oh.
And the cherry on top!

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.885
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:05.012
The video?
You don't need to ruin Diane.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.389
Let's-- Let's-- Come on.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.974
-Let's talk about this.
-Hmm, see, thing is,

01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:10.852
I promised this rodent
that I would.

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:13.229
Kind of a quid pro quo
type thing.

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:15.565
-Marmalade.
-I know.

01:02:15.606 --> 01:02:17.275
What a goofball.

01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:20.528
But a real wiz
with the science stuff.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.029
I-I'll tell you what.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:25.908
'Cause we're friends,
I'm gonna give you a choice.

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.706
No, no, no, no, no! Stop it.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.417
You can stop it with this.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:38.838
What the...

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:44.385
The upload is paired
to the magnet.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:48.222
The moment you turn it off,
the video goes viral.

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:51.517
Or leave it on, protect Diane,

01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:55.021
but y'all keep dangling
until the police arrive.

01:02:55.062 --> 01:02:57.774
Oh, such a dilemma.

01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:01.068
The police?

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.487
Hello. Commissioner speaking.

01:03:02.528 --> 01:03:04.864
Yes, ma'am. I got a hot tip.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:07.033
The Bad Guys are holed up
in a hangar

01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:08.409
two klicks north
of the MoonX launch site.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.661
What? W-Wait. Wh-Who is...

01:03:10.703 --> 01:03:12.246
Sorry, doll.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:13.998
Look, it's nothing personal.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.876
You are so hot right now.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.628
-Snake!
-Yeah?

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:19.670
Come on, man.

01:03:19.712 --> 01:03:22.089
You are one twisted reptile.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:25.134
I wish I could stick around
to see how it ends,

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:27.720
but we've got a rocket to steal.

01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:29.180
Ciao.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:31.974
Kitty. Kitty, wait.
Hold on a second, please.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.482
See? This is why
I'm not a cat person.

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:42.819
How are we supposed to choose?

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.695
We're not.
I don't give up that easy.

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:46.197
-Piranha.
-Yeah?

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.782
I need you to pull out the USB.
Follow my lead.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.325

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.852
You know, I'm very hands-on.

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:05.980
Especially when someone tries
to frame my friends.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:09.483
I know everything.
The MacGuffinite. The magnet.

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.986
Hmm.
You talked to Marmalade.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:14.822
Actually, he did
most of the talking.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.366
I'm more of an action girl.

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.662
Step aside before anger
becomes punch.

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:54.695
You're all under arrest.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.155
Governor's orders.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:59.075
Ooh, feisty.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:02.078
You don't know, do you?

01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:03.704
You're not governor anymore.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:05.664
You might want to check
your phone.

01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:07.166
Crimson Paw.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:10.127
Crimson... What?

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:15.382
No. No, no, no, no, no. But...

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.388
How-- H-How?

01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:32.024
They never expect the dart.

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:34.026
Shall we?

01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:37.696
Kitty!

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:40.366
Kitty.

01:08:55.422 --> 01:08:58.175
A viral video has revealed
that the notorious thief

01:08:58.217 --> 01:09:00.177
known as the Crimson Paw was

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.430
none other than Governor
Diane Foxington!

01:09:03.472 --> 01:09:05.850
While police search
for the rogue politician,

01:09:05.891 --> 01:09:08.561
they have wasted no time
in ordering the speedy release

01:09:08.602 --> 01:09:11.355
of sweet, adorable
Professor Marmalade,

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:15.943
unlike the Bad Guys,
whose claim to have "changed"

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:18.445
fooled absolutely no one.

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.906
Chief, we were set up
by a gang of supercriminals.

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:22.616
They turned the MacGuffinite
into a gold magnet.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.160
-Back in line.
-And they're stealing

01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:26.203
that rocket to take it to space.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:28.080
Yeah, that's what they all say.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:31.458
Ch-Chief, I know it looks bad,
but if we did this,

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.961
why would we help you
solve the case?

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:35.880
Why would we tell you
about the MacGuffinite?

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.632
And where's the loot?
You know it doesn't add up.

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.634
Look, we don't have proof,

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:44.638
but I know, somewhere in that
big, booming heart of yours,

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.766
you know we didn't do this.

01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:49.685
Chief, please.

01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:55.357
How many times
do I have to tell you, Wolf?

01:09:55.399 --> 01:09:57.651
It's "Commissioner."

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.330
Ready to fly this thing?

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:12.333
With watch, rocket flies itself.

01:10:18.505 --> 01:10:20.633
Hey, Jenny. You seeing this?

01:10:20.674 --> 01:10:21.759
Uh...

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:52.248
So much for Piranha Street.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.472
Ow.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:12.017
Chief?

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:14.144
Okay, let's say,
hypothetically, I believe you--

01:11:14.186 --> 01:11:15.646
Which I don't.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:18.983
But if I did... if I did
and some supercriminal

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:22.236
has a gold magnet,
how would we stop them?

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.780
You... you believe us?

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.621
No! No, no, no!

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:33.956
No! No!

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:35.499
I want to give her a hug.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:36.917
Ooh, I like Chief.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.169
Ooh, wow, Chief,
is that a new shampoo?

01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:40.587
Okay, okay.

01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:42.256
Please stop with the touching.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.799
I don't get you guys.

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:45.509
You're good, then you're bad,
then you're sort of good,

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:47.094
then really bad.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.679
Ugh, it's hard to keep up!

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:51.265
Yep, yep. That's fair.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:53.142
I get it.
We're all over the place.

01:11:53.183 --> 01:11:55.978
But you need to get us to that
rocket before it takes off.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:59.148
Rocket? What-what are you
talking about?

01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:02.609
Initiating backwards counting.

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.153
Countdown initiated.

01:12:04.194 --> 01:12:07.406
Countdown initiated?
Whoa. What's going on?

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:09.450
-I don't know.
-Well, shut it down, Jenny!

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.535
-Shut it down!
-I'm trying, Jim!

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:12.786
Uh, Mr. Moon?

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:14.496
Uh, we've got
a slight situation.

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:16.040
The launch isn't
until next wee--

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:22.921
Well, butter my crumpets.

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:32.806
Five, four...

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.433
Evacuate!

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:37.811
...three, two, one.

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.701
Woo-hoo!

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:57.206
The twists just keep coming.

01:12:57.247 --> 01:13:00.959
The MoonX rocket seems to have
taken off three days early--

01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:02.378
Huh?

01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:04.505
What the hairbrush?

01:13:07.132 --> 01:13:09.385
Yeah!

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.304
Uh-oh.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:13.555
Bring it on!

01:13:13.597 --> 01:13:16.183
Whoa!

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.075
Holy moly.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.163
Are you sure about this?!

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:40.374
Not particularly. No.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:44.420
Remember, when you come back,
you're under arrest!

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:48.090
You got it... Commissioner.

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.510
Go get 'em, guys.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.848
All right, here we go.

01:13:55.889 --> 01:13:57.766
First time
for everything, right?

01:14:19.496 --> 01:14:21.415
-Run, run, run! Let's go!
-Come on!

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:23.792
Go! Go! Go!

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:30.674
-Let's go, go, go, go, go!
-Guys, come on!

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:31.967
Move, move, move!

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:36.930
-We did it. We did it.
We did it. -Yeah!

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.599
-Woo-hoo!
-We did it!

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.268
We didn't do it.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.020
Jump!

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:56.950
Pull us up, Snake!

01:14:56.992 --> 01:15:00.746
Vinyasa, baby!

01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:05.501
Up there! The cargo bay!

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.600
Pull!

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:24.102
Come on! Pull! Pull!

01:15:24.144 --> 01:15:25.646
Are you kidding me?!

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:27.856
Lefty-loosey, righty-tighty.

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:31.610
Oh, right.

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:33.862
What is it?

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:40.869
Ah, never mind. Just glitch.

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:45.332
Whoa.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:50.045
Now, that is a view.

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:58.345
What is happening?!

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:01.390
Sir, they're heading to the
Multinational Space Station.

01:16:01.431 --> 01:16:02.891
I think they're docking.

01:16:19.199 --> 01:16:21.868
Doom, you're with me.

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:25.706
Pigtail, get the MacGuffinite
in place.

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:28.750
You got it, Kitty.

01:16:33.338 --> 01:16:35.591
Yoo-hoo. Anybody home?

01:16:43.473 --> 01:16:45.392
Ooh, nice decor.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.311
Very, uh, space-y.

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.943
In hindsight,
that was a little reckless.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.653
Did everybody make it?

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.530
Hey, wh-where's Piranha?

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.240
Whee!

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.826
I can fly!

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:05.621
I just needed to believe
in myself. Ha!

01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:06.955
Whoa.

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:09.291
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:11.585
Oh, you...
you guys can fly, too?

01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:16.423
All right, watch the legs.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.967
Whoa. Guys, check this out.

01:17:19.843 --> 01:17:21.386
What is she doing?

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.108
They're using
the MoonX Power Cell

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.653
to activate the MacGuffinite.

01:17:38.528 --> 01:17:39.988
Kind of genius.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:47.245
Yeah, they're smart,

01:17:47.287 --> 01:17:49.331
but there's something
they didn't count on.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.876
I got a plan.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.964
Mm-hmm. Installation complete.

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:00.676
Confirming coordinates.

01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:20.696
Shouldn't we, uh, get
some special training for this?

01:18:20.737 --> 01:18:22.447
Just don't-don't look down.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:28.328
Uh, follow-up question:
Which way is down?

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.496
Listen up.

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.081
This is all about timing.

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.417
Webs, Shark, I need you
to hack the external console

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:36.837
while Snake and Piranha pop
the control panel to engage

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.463
-the manual override switch.
-You got it.

01:18:38.505 --> 01:18:41.675
-And what about Kitty?
-Leave her to me.

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:43.343
We got one shot
to save the world.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:45.303
Let's make it count.

01:18:47.013 --> 01:18:48.390
Okay, buddy. You can do this.

01:18:48.432 --> 01:18:50.684
-First, clear the root folder.
-Mm-hmm.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.394
Then in system directory, type

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:54.730
-"ENC underscore word equals
word dot encode." -Mm-hmm.

01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:56.398
Now "import hashlib."

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.816
-Mm-hmm.
-Hit enter.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:59.568
Then "input underscore path
equals input."

01:18:59.609 --> 01:19:01.820
Okay. Cool, cool. Got it.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:06.158
Okay, so, clear
the root folder, you say.

01:19:08.326 --> 01:19:10.412
Okay, come on.
Come on, Piranha.

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:11.913
You're not nervous, right?

01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:14.291
'Cause we know what happens
when you're nervous.

01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:17.544
Wh-What would I be
nervous about?

01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:20.756
Oh. Piranha!

01:19:20.797 --> 01:19:21.757
-Dude!
-Sorry.

01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:24.384
I can taste it.

01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:29.014
We're in position.

01:19:29.055 --> 01:19:32.267
I think it's time
we introduced ourselves.

01:19:35.645 --> 01:19:38.440
♪ People, people,
dancing on the people... ♪

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:43.904

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:48.658

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.368
Huh.

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:58.084

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.885
Oh. Thank you.

01:20:09.554 --> 01:20:11.181
Oh. Thank you.

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.476
What's going on?
Why am I flying?

01:20:31.868 --> 01:20:33.119
Holy potatoes.

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.746
It's actually working.

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.122
Ooh, yeah!

01:20:38.291 --> 01:20:39.209
Oh, boy.

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:41.711
-How we doing, Snake?
-Hang on.

01:20:41.753 --> 01:20:42.921
Got it!

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:45.799
Like stealing candy and a baby.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.176
Don't you mean
"candy from a baby"?

01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:49.970
I know what I said.

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.304
How about the air lock?

01:20:53.807 --> 01:20:56.726
All right, Webs.
I like your style.

01:20:56.768 --> 01:20:58.812
Oh, that one was all Shark.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.146
I panicked.

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:02.148
But it worked out.
I'm a programmer now.

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.359
I'm going in.

01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:09.865
-What was that?
-Huh?

01:21:12.158 --> 01:21:14.411
Oh, that's not good.

01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:22.836
Uh...

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.588
Snake, buddy, I'm sorry.

01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:25.881
What? No, no, no...

01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:30.176
I hate you.

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:35.849
Get to the air lock!

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.517
Go, go, go!

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.525
Girls, nothing gonna
stop us now.

01:21:51.865 --> 01:21:53.533
Snakey Cakes?

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:56.661
Help... me.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:01.041
Stop farting, you maniac!

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:02.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:05.170
Turn it off, all right?
You're gonna kill them.

01:22:05.211 --> 01:22:07.464
I'm sorry.
Whose side are you on?

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.717
Kitty, stop! It's just a heist.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.802
It's never just a heist!

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:17.098
Secure the air lock. Now.

01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:19.392
Whatever you say, boss.

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:29.319
"Turn it off."

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:32.364
Ha! I'm just getting started.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.718
It is total mayhem!

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.721
A cataclysmic gold storm is
literally destroying the city!

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.438
Oh, yeah.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.773
The gold.

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:08.149
Come to mama.

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:10.026
You know,
I've been thinking.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:11.319
Wolf?

01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:13.363
Doesn't that word sound
kind of made-up?

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:14.948
"Gold."
It's kind of weird, right?

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:16.950
--It's weird.
It's weird-- It's a weird word.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:19.786
Go ahead. S-Say, say, "Gold."

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:23.081
Gold. Gold. Gold.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:24.457
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:27.293
I'm gonna need you
to turn off the magnet.

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:29.212
Or I'll just do it for you.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:31.756
Is that supposed to be funny?

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.183
Stay with me, papo.

01:23:42.225 --> 01:23:43.476
Stay with me!

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:45.979
I-I don't want
to die like this.

01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:49.441
Oof.

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:57.490
Okay, okay.

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:59.325
Come on, Piranha, your friend
is spinning out in space.

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:01.619
You should know what to do.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:04.289
That's it! The pen!

01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:05.749
The pen? Wha...

01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:08.084
Grab the pen! The pen!
Grab the...

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:09.836
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:12.922
Okay, I can do stuff.
I can do stuff.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:26.770
Why would you risk your life
to save people who wouldn't even

01:24:26.811 --> 01:24:28.396
give you a chance?

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:35.278
At least when you were the Big
Bad Wolf, they respected you.

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.031
Oh, that was respect, huh?

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.699
That wasn't respect.
That was fear.

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.868
Oh, whatever, man.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.119
What's the difference?

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:45.371
Trust me, there's a difference.

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:47.290
Respect is earned.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:49.584
One day, you'll learn that.

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:15.527
Honestly, Wolf, what made
you think this would work?

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.238
Who says it didn't?

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:21.491
Like you said,
it's not about the action.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:23.493
It's about the distraction.

01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:30.583
Hey, genius, the watch controls
the shuttle, not the magnet.

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:32.961
You get it.

01:25:33.002 --> 01:25:34.796
She gets it.

01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:46.099
Got it!

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.892
You sure about this?

01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:50.061
Trust me, chico.

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:52.147
Tuna power!

01:26:01.906 --> 01:26:03.533
I got it!

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.872
Well done, boys.
Webs, tell me you're ready.

01:26:08.913 --> 01:26:10.540
Lining it up, Wolfie.

01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:15.753
Nice work, kid.

01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:16.838
No.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.424
You want to see
a power move, Kitty?

01:26:19.465 --> 01:26:22.135
This is a power move.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:56.377
It's fine.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:58.671
--Huh?
-Hello!

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:02.175
-Need a hand?
-I got you, Snakey Cakes.

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.510
Oh, Sugar Beak.

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:07.931
And you said
you weren't into me.

01:27:07.972 --> 01:27:12.227
Why would you believe
anything I say?

01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:14.604
No!

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:19.984
How do you expect to get back
to Earth without a shuttle?!

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:22.278
At least there's an Earth
to go back...

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.323
You destroyed my beautiful plan!

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:49.555
What did I tell you about
messing with my friends?

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:51.391
-Wha-- How did you...
-Wolf, we got-- Oh.

01:28:01.317 --> 01:28:03.695
We tried to stop her
from posting...

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:13.830
Ah, wow. What happened
to medium friendly?

01:28:13.871 --> 01:28:17.166
Well, good thing I'm
not the governor anymore, huh?

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.754
Ugh, gross.

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:23.756
-'Bout time.
-Guys!

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:24.924
Whoa! Diane.

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.426
What are you doing here?

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:28.136
Just happened to be
orbiting the Earth.

01:28:28.177 --> 01:28:29.304
Thought I'd drop by.

01:28:29.345 --> 01:28:31.014
-Woo-hoo!
-Yeah!

01:28:31.055 --> 01:28:32.682
We did it, baby.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:34.142
I feel the love.
Like, I feel it.

01:28:34.183 --> 01:28:37.770
I hear about the famous
Bad Guys all my life.

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.939
But now I get it.

01:28:42.358 --> 01:28:43.985
Alert.

01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:48.990
Alert.

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:52.327
Alert.

01:28:53.077 --> 01:28:55.288
-It is a massive system failure.
-Alert.

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:57.290
We're falling out of orbit.

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:09.469
I think this is it, Wolfie.

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:10.511
We're doomed!

01:29:10.553 --> 01:29:11.804
One last hug, everybody?

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:13.848
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.600
Don't talk like that.

01:29:15.641 --> 01:29:19.312
Sure, it's-- it looks--
yeah, it's bad.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.105
Yeah, okay. It's bad.

01:29:21.147 --> 01:29:22.940
Sure, we're hurtling
towards Earth in a tin can,

01:29:22.982 --> 01:29:24.567
staring squarely
into the face of death.

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:27.153
Sure, our blood may boil,
our bones may liquefy,

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:29.989
but if there's one thing
that I know about this crew,

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:34.118
it's that we never,
ever give up.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.622
Because we have something
that's stronger than fear,

01:29:37.663 --> 01:29:39.999
stronger than even gravity.

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.334
And that's hope.

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.211
Yeah, hope.

01:29:43.252 --> 01:29:44.879
That's hope.

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:48.633
We're gonna land this thing...

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:51.010
...or we're gonna die tryi--

01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:01.062
What those guys,

01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:03.940
those brave, beautiful guys
did up there,

01:30:03.981 --> 01:30:08.861
saving the world from
a 24-karat catastrophe.

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:12.281
And despite all the rejection
and suspicion,

01:30:12.323 --> 01:30:17.078
all the tiny humiliations,
they did it for us.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.914
They didn't do it
for the fame or for the glory.

01:30:19.956 --> 01:30:22.834
They did it for us.

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:25.128
They weren't just good guys.

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.589
They were my best friends.

01:30:28.631 --> 01:30:31.592
And I would give anything
to arrest them

01:30:31.634 --> 01:30:33.803
just one more time.

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:42.061
This one's for you, Wolfie!

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:49.569
I, for one, am outraged that
it took an evil space magnet

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:52.029
for people to realize
that the Bad Guys

01:30:52.071 --> 01:30:55.032
were worthy of our love
all along.

01:30:55.074 --> 01:30:58.119
But it's too late,
because now they're dead.

01:31:00.329 --> 01:31:02.081
Ironically, the only survivors

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:03.916
were the perpetrators
of the heist,

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:07.211
including the supercriminal
known as the Phantom Bandit,

01:31:07.253 --> 01:31:11.048
while a second escape pod
was, tragically, empty.

01:31:23.352 --> 01:31:25.313
Did I sell it or did I sell it?

01:31:25.354 --> 01:31:27.982
Are you gonna tell us
what this is all about?

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:29.692
Yeah, 'cause I don't feel dead.

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:31.110
And who are the suits?

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:34.405
And why are they wearing
sunglasses inside?

01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:35.823
Hmm?

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:39.076
I know. I know it seems
elaborate, but trust me,

01:31:39.118 --> 01:31:43.164
it's the best way if you want
to do some serious good.

01:31:43.206 --> 01:31:45.124
Gentlemen. Ladies.

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.793
You have been identified
as ideal candidates

01:31:47.835 --> 01:31:50.671
for a brand-new, ultra-elite
unit of secret operatives

01:31:50.713 --> 01:31:53.090
that we're calling
the International

01:31:53.132 --> 01:31:55.593
Super-Galactic League
of Protectors:

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:57.970
ISGLOP.

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:00.306
-Huh?
-Sounds kind of made-up.

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:02.433
I-I don't understand.
What-What's happening?

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:03.768
We're offering you a job, son.

01:32:03.809 --> 01:32:06.812
You're gonna be secret agents!

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:07.980
Huh?

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:09.815
-Is he serious?
-That can't be right.

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:11.817
Secret agents? Get out of here.

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:14.111
-They're serious? Really?
-That's what I'm talking about!

01:32:14.153 --> 01:32:15.988
-Woo-hoo! -Nice.
-All right.

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.933
Hey. Almost forgot
you were there.

01:32:43.975 --> 01:32:46.060
As you might have noticed,
change isn't easy.

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:50.815
Some days, it's gonna feel
downright hopeless.

01:32:50.856 --> 01:32:52.942
But with the right attitude

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:55.194
and the right friends,

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.697
the good life
has a way of finding you.

01:32:57.738 --> 01:33:01.367
Ready to get to work,
Agent Wolf?

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:03.160
Not bad.

01:33:03.202 --> 01:33:04.370
Not bad at all.

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.668

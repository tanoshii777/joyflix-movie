00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.851
Me?

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:54.723
I'm...

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.011
Come on!

00:02:22.054 --> 00:02:23.665
Fuck!

00:02:25.014 --> 00:02:26.755
You missed the garbage.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.829
You missed the garbage.

00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:41.063
Put the phone down.

00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:43.413
We don't want any trouble.

00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:45.459
Your money. Cash.

00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:46.982
Now!

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:50.899
Th-That's about all there is,
on that.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.815
That-that's it?

00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:56.557
I use a debit card.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.385
Jesus.

00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:02.084
I didn't find anything.

00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:03.433
What about his watch?

00:05:03.477 --> 00:05:05.957
Is this worth something?

00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:07.481
To me, it is.

00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:10.005
Take it.

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:17.186
Give me your ring.

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.796
Give me your fucking ring!

00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:21.538
Hey!

00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:24.541
Hey! Hey, get off him! Now!

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.631
Get off him! Get off him!

00:05:27.675 --> 00:05:29.590
I swear to God,
I'll fucking shoot you!

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:30.852
Dad!

00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:35.857
Now!

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.120
Let him go, son.

00:05:39.077 --> 00:05:41.515
What?

00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:43.604
I said let him go.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.480
- Hey!
- What? What?

00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:52.221
Please stop.

00:05:52.264 --> 00:05:54.876
Just take what you want and go.
Please just...

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.007
Just shut up!

00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:57.444
Let's get out of here.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.273
Baby, let's go.

00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:03.667
We picked the wrong
fucking house.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.105
- Just... fucking shit!
- Shut up.

00:06:17.202 --> 00:06:19.248
What the fuck, Dad?

00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:37.092
I can't believe
I let this happen.

00:06:38.093 --> 00:06:40.051
My beautiful wife,

00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:43.141
beautiful kids, my home,

00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:45.317
broken into with a freaking...

00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:47.711
- Mr. Mansell.
- Excuse me?

00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:49.931
So, that's how they got in, huh?

00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:52.020
Using a pizza box?

00:06:52.063 --> 00:06:53.630
Yeah.

00:06:53.674 --> 00:06:55.371
And the golf club?

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.025
Did you even take a swing?

00:06:57.068 --> 00:06:58.330
She had a, uh...

00:06:58.374 --> 00:07:00.463
Could've taken her, Dad.

00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:03.423
Look, you did the right thing,
Mr. Mansell.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.908
You know, if that was
my family...

00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:16.131
We're gonna get out
of your hair.

00:07:16.174 --> 00:07:19.656
You just leave that
garage door closed, okay?

00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:23.285
Hey, Dad.

00:08:23.328 --> 00:08:24.678
Hey, kiddo.

00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:27.245
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:28.464
Well...

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.379
Oh.

00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:34.557
You scared?

00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:37.778
Why would I be? You're here.

00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.041
Yeah.

00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:45.089
Dad?

00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:46.264
Yeah?

00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:48.397
We need a cat.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.834
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:08:51.922 --> 00:08:53.924
Yeah.

00:08:53.968 --> 00:08:56.840
I was thinking the same thing.

00:09:10.898 --> 00:09:12.290
Come on!

00:09:13.988 --> 00:09:15.163
Fuck!

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.739
So, uh, I have to do a report
on a veteran for history class.

00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:27.741
Think I could just
interview you?

00:09:28.785 --> 00:09:31.179
Yeah, sure, son. Um...

00:09:31.222 --> 00:09:34.617
you know, I was an auditor,
so kind of a nobody.

00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:37.228
That makes for
a pretty dry story.

00:09:37.272 --> 00:09:39.622
Yeah, I-I really don't...
don't care.

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:41.426
Just want to finish up
the project and call it a day.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.017
What about your uncle Charlie?

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.584
He was a real soldier.

00:09:45.802 --> 00:09:47.195
I didn't mean it.

00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:49.023
Oh, your mom's right.

00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:50.677
Hey, you know what, uh,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.330
I actually already
left him a message.

00:09:53.331 --> 00:09:54.681
I'll try again later.

00:09:54.724 --> 00:09:56.552
Could try Grandpa.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.815
He actually saw some action.

00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:00.904
Yeah, maybe.

00:10:02.776 --> 00:10:04.342
Have a great day.

00:10:04.386 --> 00:10:06.083
Oh, and, um...

00:10:06.127 --> 00:10:08.085
you missed the garbage.

00:10:10.697 --> 00:10:13.134
I just...

00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:21.055
Oh, I took all the coffee.

00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:26.974
Have a good day, Hutch.

00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:28.715
Yeah, you, too.

00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:30.194
All right, kids, let's go.
Come on.

00:10:30.238 --> 00:10:32.109
Let's go.

00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:58.570
Put on your seat belt, okay?

00:10:58.614 --> 00:11:00.442
Hold on.

00:11:05.142 --> 00:11:06.709
Hey.

00:11:06.753 --> 00:11:09.190
Heard you had some excitement
last night.

00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:10.844
Yeah, it was just, uh...

00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:12.847
Man, I wish they'd have picked
my place, you know?

00:11:13.542 --> 00:11:16.719
Could've used the exercise.

00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:20.244
That's new.

00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:21.855
Pretty cool, huh?

00:11:21.898 --> 00:11:23.639
Yeah, the old man croaked.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.119
He didn't have much to leave,

00:11:25.162 --> 00:11:26.773
but at least I got
something out of it.

00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:28.209
Honey, come on.

00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:30.472
Got to go.

00:11:30.515 --> 00:11:32.779
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:35.346
There's nothing there
to mourn, man.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.087
Pretty slick, though, huh?

00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:40.525
The '72 Challenger,
4.9-liter V-8.

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:45.182
Zero to 60 in...
I'm about to find the fuck out.

00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:47.837

00:11:51.493 --> 00:11:54.539
♪ You're a heartbreaker ♪

00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:11.382
What do we got?
A rat or a possum?

00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:13.167
Don't know.

00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:21.958
So...

00:12:22.002 --> 00:12:23.655
Good morning, Charlie.

00:12:23.699 --> 00:12:25.527
Did I hear right?

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.877
Depends who you talked to.

00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:31.141
Well, your boy called.

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.361
Then, yeah, you heard right.

00:12:35.842 --> 00:12:39.497
Now, he says that you had
the drop on one of them.

00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:41.935
Why didn't you take 'em out?

00:12:41.978 --> 00:12:43.632
I mean, shit...

00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:45.416
it's child's play.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.158
I was just trying to keep damage
to a minimum.

00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:49.899
Oh, yeah?
How's that working out for you?

00:12:49.943 --> 00:12:52.206
Everybody's safe, so... Jesus!

00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:54.991
Don't worry.

00:12:55.035 --> 00:12:57.124
Safety's on.

00:12:58.647 --> 00:12:59.866
No, wait.

00:12:59.909 --> 00:13:02.303
Oops. There.

00:13:02.346 --> 00:13:04.392
There. See?

00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:07.830
Now, there's nothing that
turns out the lights right quick

00:13:07.874 --> 00:13:10.615
like a fucking bullet
to the brain, man.

00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:13.270
So... take it.

00:13:13.314 --> 00:13:15.272
I don't want it.

00:13:16.578 --> 00:13:18.623
It ain't a matter of want,
Hutch.

00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:20.451
It's the principle of need.

00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:24.586
So, keep my sister safe, bro.

00:13:57.358 --> 00:13:59.099
Hey.

00:14:00.317 --> 00:14:01.536
Oh, hey.

00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:03.799
Uh, I take it Becca called you.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.932
She did.

00:14:05.975 --> 00:14:08.630
And I'm thinking you did
the best thing you could.

00:14:10.023 --> 00:14:12.068
I mean, you being you.

00:14:12.112 --> 00:14:13.896
Yeah. I got you.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.943
Look, let's talk about you
wanting to buy this place.

00:14:16.986 --> 00:14:19.467
Do you really want to get rid
of me and Charlie that bad?

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.903
Eddie, you're family.

00:14:20.947 --> 00:14:22.731
I just want you to enjoy
your retirement

00:14:22.774 --> 00:14:24.951
and Charlie his youth.

00:14:24.994 --> 00:14:27.214
It's a fair offer.

00:14:27.257 --> 00:14:30.173
But not a great one, you know.

00:14:30.217 --> 00:14:33.046
Look, I built this place up
from nothing with my hands.

00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:37.354
If I'm going to sell it,
then I want it to be a...

00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:39.269
goddamn great offer.

00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:40.923
- You know?
- Yeah.

00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:43.752
What do you want
with this place, anyway?

00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:47.669
Guess I just want something
that's mine, you know?

00:14:48.757 --> 00:14:50.715
I do.

00:14:52.717 --> 00:14:54.763
Hey, Hutch.

00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:57.548
I'm rooting for you.

00:15:55.258 --> 00:15:56.956
Sounded good.

00:15:56.999 --> 00:15:59.132
How long you been listening?

00:16:00.307 --> 00:16:02.874
Long enough to know you're
getting mighty good at that.

00:16:02.918 --> 00:16:05.051
Shit.
When you're officially dead,

00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:07.705
got a lot of free time
on your hands, you know?

00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:09.577
Rough life.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.318
So, tell me about last night.

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:14.669
Word travels fast, huh?

00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:18.194
Look,
if they know, I know, you know?

00:16:19.717 --> 00:16:21.545
There were two of them.

00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:23.895
A man and a woman.

00:16:23.939 --> 00:16:26.724
Uh, late 20s, I'd say.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.816
They were scared.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.514
Desperate.

00:16:33.557 --> 00:16:35.559
She had a gun.

00:16:35.603 --> 00:16:37.518
What kind?

00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:40.086
Uh, it was an old .38 Special.

00:16:41.913 --> 00:16:44.003
Had electrical tape
on the handle.

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:46.657
It was a Smith & Wesson.

00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:49.008
Hadn't been shot
in a long while.

00:16:50.096 --> 00:16:52.228
And it was, uh...

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.756
empty.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.803
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

00:17:01.846 --> 00:17:05.676
Hmm. Now I know why you
didn't do what you didn't do.

00:17:07.635 --> 00:17:09.376
What'd they get?

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:12.509
Not much. Just a couple bucks.

00:17:12.553 --> 00:17:15.512
Well, I guess it
could've been worse, man.

00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:17.427
Yeah.

00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:20.300
Look, I know what
you're thinking about,

00:17:20.343 --> 00:17:22.389
and I wish you wasn't.

00:17:22.432 --> 00:17:25.609
Don't do nothing stupid.
You hear me?

00:17:44.585 --> 00:17:47.370
Hey, Dad.

00:17:47.414 --> 00:17:50.025
- You been eating?
- What?

00:17:58.338 --> 00:18:00.209
You okay?

00:18:02.864 --> 00:18:04.866
I'm okay.

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.087
You don't look okay.

00:18:15.442 --> 00:18:18.401
Do you remember who
we used to be, Hutchie?

00:18:18.445 --> 00:18:19.750
I do.

00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:38.247
Hey, buddy.

00:18:38.291 --> 00:18:39.466
How was school?

00:18:39.509 --> 00:18:40.684
Fine.

00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:42.512
Hi, sweetheart.

00:18:42.556 --> 00:18:44.819
Come on. Help out.

00:18:44.862 --> 00:18:46.734
How was today?

00:18:46.777 --> 00:18:49.302
- It was what it was.
- I can't find it.

00:18:49.345 --> 00:18:51.304
- Ugh.
- You can't find what?

00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:53.088
My kitty cat bracelet.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.481
Where was it?

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.181
In here.

00:18:59.225 --> 00:19:03.185
They couldn't have stolen that,
would they?

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:11.280
Honey, I'm sure
it'll turn up somewhere.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.054
Back so soon?

00:19:46.097 --> 00:19:48.012
Hey, Pop.

00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:53.931
There's this thing I got to do.

00:19:53.975 --> 00:19:56.586

Agent Mansell, FBI.

00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:19.321
- That's old.
- I'm looking for...

00:21:19.365 --> 00:21:21.280
What?

00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:25.762
Your I.D... the badge expired
by about 20 years.

00:21:25.806 --> 00:21:28.461
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that ain't you in the photo.

00:21:28.504 --> 00:21:29.984
So...

00:21:32.421 --> 00:21:33.596
Who are you?

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.907
I'm just a man...

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.996
who's looking for someone.

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:43.998
Yeah, well,
you probably shouldn't

00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:46.261
flash cheese like that
around here, bro.

00:21:47.436 --> 00:21:51.353
There are three types of people
who, as you say, "flash cheese":

00:21:51.397 --> 00:21:52.963
People who don't know
any better,

00:21:53.007 --> 00:21:54.922
people who are seeking
to intimidate,

00:21:54.965 --> 00:21:57.751
and people like me, who wish
with every fiber of their being

00:21:57.794 --> 00:21:59.883
that someone would try
to take it from them.

00:22:04.758 --> 00:22:07.326
Uh...

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.634
Thank you for your service.

00:22:14.289 --> 00:22:16.465
You, too, old-timer.

00:22:30.174 --> 00:22:32.916
So, any takers?

00:22:37.486 --> 00:22:39.662
How can I help you?

00:22:39.706 --> 00:22:43.449
Send me in the direction
of this person.

00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:21.661
Luis.

00:23:49.384 --> 00:23:50.820
I speak. You listen.

00:23:50.864 --> 00:23:53.170
You know why I'm here.

00:23:53.214 --> 00:23:54.824
'Cause I'm a good man.

00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:56.435
I'm a family man.

00:23:56.478 --> 00:23:58.064
Most of all, I'm a man
who did not deserve

00:23:58.088 --> 00:24:00.526
your gun in his face.

00:24:00.569 --> 00:24:02.441
Now, the watch.

00:24:07.707 --> 00:24:10.144
The kitty cat bracelet.

00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:13.495

what the fuck you're...

00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:16.672

bracelet, motherfucker!

00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:18.282

you're talking about.

I swear to God, I don't know.

00:24:19.936 --> 00:24:21.653

Hey, guys, guys.

00:27:41.703 --> 00:27:44.097

old man?

00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:52.627
I'm gonna fuck you up.

Oh, fuck!

00:29:47.611 --> 00:29:49.309
Nose!

My fucking teeth.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.885
- Is it bad?
- It's bad.

00:29:59.928 --> 00:30:01.582
Fuck!

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.419
Your arm is fucked up.

00:30:12.462 --> 00:30:14.290

00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:16.379
Man, are you...

00:30:17.554 --> 00:30:19.295
Fucked up.

00:30:33.744 --> 00:30:35.877

00:30:37.748 --> 00:30:40.012
Thank you.

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:06.925
Sorry about the mess.

00:32:37.346 --> 00:32:39.392
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:32:41.568 --> 00:32:43.613
I couldn't sleep.

00:32:45.702 --> 00:32:47.748
Where'd you go?

00:33:00.804 --> 00:33:03.024
Yeah.

00:33:03.068 --> 00:33:05.113
It's been a hell of a day.

00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:08.987
I can see that.

00:33:10.249 --> 00:33:12.381
Just like old times, huh?

00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:14.688
Mm-hmm.

00:33:21.086 --> 00:33:23.088

00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:27.614

00:33:27.657 --> 00:33:29.659
I'm always right here.

00:33:30.747 --> 00:33:32.532
I know.

00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:39.321
Tonight...

00:33:39.365 --> 00:33:41.454
I was thinking...

00:33:41.497 --> 00:33:43.195
About what?

00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:46.807
About...

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.418
Becca.

00:33:53.074 --> 00:33:57.644
How we haven't embraced
in far too long.

00:33:57.687 --> 00:34:02.083
We haven't shared a kiss in...
I don't know.

00:34:02.127 --> 00:34:05.913
We haven't had sex in months.

00:34:05.956 --> 00:34:10.570
We haven't made love in years.

00:34:12.485 --> 00:34:14.791
You seem so far away.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:21.189
I know that's... it's unfair
to put it like that, but...

00:34:21.233 --> 00:34:23.757
I just...

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.064
I-I miss you.

00:34:37.205 --> 00:34:39.686
Remember who we used to be?

00:34:43.168 --> 00:34:44.995
I do.

00:36:09.384 --> 00:36:12.170
All right, man, there he is!

00:36:13.823 --> 00:36:15.521
Hi.

00:36:33.539 --> 00:36:35.584
On the house, sir.

00:37:43.478 --> 00:37:45.088
Ah.

00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:16.414
Will he walk again?

00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:20.461
Sir, we are
monitoring his vitals,

00:40:20.505 --> 00:40:23.638
but the damage
to his brain is...

00:40:44.006 --> 00:40:46.139
Dr. Mendez to Critical Care.

00:40:46.182 --> 00:40:47.445
Dr. Mendez.

00:40:51.536 --> 00:40:53.886
Yulian...

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.150
Who did this to my brother?

00:40:57.193 --> 00:40:58.804
There was a man.

00:40:58.847 --> 00:41:00.501
He attacked us unprovoked.

00:41:00.545 --> 00:41:02.895
One man?
Are you fucking with me?

00:41:02.938 --> 00:41:04.525
- No, sir. No, sir!
- Don't you lie to me!

00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:07.508
Don't you fucking lie to me!

00:41:07.552 --> 00:41:09.336
Don't you...

00:41:09.379 --> 00:41:11.338
Don't you lie to me!

00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:13.296
Don't you fucking lie to me!

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.081
I'm not lying to you. I swear.

00:41:17.605 --> 00:41:19.346
Yulian?

00:41:20.347 --> 00:41:21.870
Please don't get more mad.

00:41:24.699 --> 00:41:26.484
You hated Teddy.

00:41:30.923 --> 00:41:34.535
Your words may be correct,

00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:36.885
but they are no less unwise.

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:53.249
How can I find this man?

00:42:19.493 --> 00:42:21.147
- Mmm.
- Morning.

00:42:22.148 --> 00:42:24.150
Morning.

00:42:24.193 --> 00:42:25.934
What happened to you?

00:42:25.978 --> 00:42:27.588
Hmm?

00:42:27.632 --> 00:42:29.372
Dad, you look like shit.

00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:31.723
You should see the other guys.

00:42:31.766 --> 00:42:33.681
When you made that tackle,

00:42:33.725 --> 00:42:36.641
that was a good takedown.

00:42:36.684 --> 00:42:39.252
You had my back,
and I'm proud of you.

00:42:40.296 --> 00:42:41.428
Morning.

00:42:41.471 --> 00:42:43.386
Morning.

00:42:46.433 --> 00:42:47.826
Hutch here.

00:42:47.869 --> 00:42:51.090
Last night, that was you, huh?

00:42:51.133 --> 00:42:53.614
I thought we said no landlines.

00:42:53.658 --> 00:42:56.138
Relax. I got 30 seconds.

00:42:56.182 --> 00:42:57.618
Okay, well, go.

00:42:57.662 --> 00:43:01.056
So, how did it feel?

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.058
Like salvation day.

00:43:03.102 --> 00:43:05.278
Yeah, I bet.

00:43:05.321 --> 00:43:08.629
Look, I'm happy that your
relapse made you feel so good,

00:43:08.673 --> 00:43:11.240
- but, man, you got a fucking problem.
- Yeah?

00:43:11.284 --> 00:43:14.504
One of those guys was the
brother of Yulian Kuznetsov,

00:43:14.548 --> 00:43:16.419
and you don't want
to fuck with him, Hutch.

00:43:16.463 --> 00:43:18.900
I'm serious.
Ask The Barber. He knows.

00:43:18.944 --> 00:43:21.033

Who was that?

00:43:24.689 --> 00:43:26.386
Just a distributor of ours.

00:43:26.429 --> 00:43:28.083
Hey, I have an idea.

00:43:28.127 --> 00:43:30.346
How about I make that lasagne
that you love tonight?

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.653
You know, from scratch,
like I used to.

00:43:32.697 --> 00:43:34.742
- It's been a while.
- Lasagna!

00:43:34.786 --> 00:43:36.875
I'd really like that.

00:44:28.317 --> 00:44:31.973

00:44:32.017 --> 00:44:35.934
What can you tell me

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:44.769
Am I really now
that predictable?

00:44:44.812 --> 00:44:47.989
From where I sit, Mr. Mansell,

00:44:48.033 --> 00:44:50.426
everyone is.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:54.517
Short story long,
he's as bad as they come.

00:44:54.561 --> 00:44:58.608
A connected, funded sociopath

00:44:58.652 --> 00:45:01.437
with resources
to make things complicated.

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.138
So, he's a bad guy?

00:45:12.013 --> 00:45:14.668
- Has he got any hobbies?
- Collects art,

00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:17.018
to the tune of eight
and nine figures.

00:45:18.237 --> 00:45:19.368
Anything good?

00:45:19.412 --> 00:45:20.543
Fuck if I know.

00:45:20.587 --> 00:45:22.415
But what I do know is,

00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:24.504
if he doesn't know
who you are yet,

00:45:24.547 --> 00:45:25.766
he will soon.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.856
What have you got for me?

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.076
I found his dad.

00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:33.252
He's got him at
a nursing home downtown.

00:45:33.295 --> 00:45:35.558
That's not much.

00:45:35.602 --> 00:45:37.473
I wouldn't worry
about this Hutch guy.

00:45:37.517 --> 00:45:40.259
Your man here looks to be
as vanilla as they come.

00:45:40.302 --> 00:45:45.525
If you can't recognize a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

00:45:45.568 --> 00:45:49.659
I question the viability
of your employment here.

00:45:49.703 --> 00:45:52.488
I have a friend at the Pentagon.

00:45:52.532 --> 00:45:54.055
I'll keep looking.

00:45:55.013 --> 00:45:57.929
One blackmail package coming up.

00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:08.504
What the fuck?

00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:14.162
What?

00:46:14.206 --> 00:46:15.337
And if he can't take care

00:46:15.381 --> 00:46:16.904
of a loose end like you,

00:46:16.948 --> 00:46:20.255
he'd have to give up
his share of the Obshak.

00:46:21.256 --> 00:46:23.302
The Obshak?

00:46:25.434 --> 00:46:27.219
Think of it like the 401

00:46:27.262 --> 00:46:29.656
of the Russian mob.

00:46:29.699 --> 00:46:31.963
That's hundreds of millions
of dollars in cash

00:46:32.006 --> 00:46:33.965
perpetually on the move,

00:46:34.008 --> 00:46:37.490
and Yulian is
the current babysitter.

00:46:37.533 --> 00:46:40.536
That said, he's more than
a bit weary of this life.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.800
I think, if he had his way,
he'd probably walk away.

00:47:14.919 --> 00:47:16.746
I'm out. No need to pay.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:18.661
Good luck.

00:47:29.803 --> 00:47:32.110
It's beautiful.

00:47:32.153 --> 00:47:33.938
May I interest you in some wine?

00:47:33.981 --> 00:47:35.417
Yes, please.

00:47:35.461 --> 00:47:37.071
Uh, I am also interested.

00:47:37.115 --> 00:47:38.464
- Nope.
- Nope.

00:47:38.507 --> 00:47:40.988
Um, who wants some?

00:47:41.032 --> 00:47:42.555
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- Me.

00:47:42.598 --> 00:47:44.252
Right. There you go.

00:47:44.296 --> 00:47:47.560
Hey, how about we all head
to Italy this summer?

00:47:47.603 --> 00:47:49.997
We've always talked
about going back.

00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:51.825
Oh, I'd love that.

00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:54.349
But, um, can we afford it?

00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:57.439
Can we afford not to?

00:47:57.483 --> 00:48:00.616
- Well, that would be wonderful.
- Yeah.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.663
'Cause, you know,
Rome is where Mom and Dad met.

00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:05.665
You know, Mom and Dad
fell in love...

00:48:05.708 --> 00:48:07.754
Ew.

00:48:19.374 --> 00:48:21.420

00:48:23.204 --> 00:48:24.640
- Let's go. Move.
- What's going on?

00:48:24.684 --> 00:48:26.009
- What is happening?
- Move! -Dad, what...

00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:27.315
- What-What's happening?
- Right now.

00:48:27.339 --> 00:48:28.818
- Hutch, you're scaring me.

- Go! Get the door, son.

00:48:29.863 --> 00:48:31.299
- Yep.
- Is this a game?

00:48:31.343 --> 00:48:32.973
- Yes, is this a game, Hutch?
- I like games.

there was this guy named Alan.

00:58:23.587 --> 00:58:25.632
Aaron.

00:58:25.676 --> 00:58:27.591
No, it was Alan.

00:58:27.634 --> 00:58:30.768
Alan skimmed
about three million bucks

00:58:30.811 --> 00:58:33.945
from a U.S. military base
in Rivolto, Italy,

00:58:33.988 --> 00:58:36.991
and his prize was me
looming over him

00:58:37.035 --> 00:58:39.428
with a Walther PPK.

00:58:39.472 --> 00:58:40.952
No, wait.

00:58:40.995 --> 00:58:42.693
Uh, it was a suppressed.

00:58:42.736 --> 00:58:46.087
H&K USP .45
at the back of his head.

00:58:46.131 --> 00:58:49.264
And he started begging,
like they all do,

00:58:49.308 --> 00:58:52.180
and I usually pulled the trigger
before the waterworks began,

00:58:52.224 --> 00:58:56.271
but this time I listened.

00:58:56.315 --> 00:59:01.146
I heard a man who
genuinely regretted his choices

00:59:01.189 --> 00:59:04.845
and wanted nothing more
than to shed his wolf skin

00:59:04.889 --> 00:59:08.153
and return to the pasture
as a lamb.

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:12.461
I quietly let Alan go.

00:59:14.463 --> 00:59:17.205
A year later,
I went back to check on him,

00:59:17.249 --> 00:59:20.078
fully expecting to find him
back unto the fold.

00:59:20.121 --> 00:59:23.255
Alan was living in Boise, Idaho.

00:59:23.298 --> 00:59:24.778
He had a wife.

00:59:24.822 --> 00:59:26.345
She came with two kids.

00:59:26.388 --> 00:59:27.651
They had another on the way.

00:59:27.694 --> 00:59:29.000
They had a dog.

00:59:29.043 --> 00:59:30.871
He was working 9:00 to 5:00.

00:59:30.915 --> 00:59:32.481
Nothing there to skim.

00:59:32.525 --> 00:59:34.048
And he was smiling.

00:59:34.092 --> 00:59:35.789
Like a goddamn Buddha.

00:59:35.833 --> 00:59:38.749
That motherfucker!

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.056
I am not a jealous guy,

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:45.582
but in that moment,
I wanted what Alan had.

00:59:47.714 --> 00:59:51.326
So I told my bosses
I was out of the game.

00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:53.546
They were not happy to hear it.

00:59:54.634 --> 00:59:57.115
They didn't believe
I could do it.

01:00:03.774 --> 01:00:05.993
I gave it my all.

01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:08.343
I really did.

01:00:11.433 --> 01:00:13.392
It was good.

01:00:13.435 --> 01:00:16.613
You know, it was better
than I expected.

01:00:19.398 --> 01:00:23.097
I might have, uh, overcorrected.

01:00:24.403 --> 01:00:25.447

01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:33.934

No, you don't.

01:04:30.127 --> 01:04:32.390
Yes, I do. Pop, don't!

01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:35.349

Three unidentified
bodies were found dead

01:05:02.289 --> 01:05:05.292
in a suspicious car accident
last night on Route 34.

01:05:05.336 --> 01:05:07.512
Authorities are still trying
to figure out the cause

01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:09.557
and if anyone else is involved.

- Hutchie boy.
- Hey.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.102
Dude, fucking with the Russians?

01:06:16.146 --> 01:06:17.495

batshit crazy Yulian?

Yeah, of course, right, right,
and get yourself shot.

01:06:25.285 --> 01:06:26.895
That's going to solve
everything.

01:06:26.939 --> 01:06:28.897
They came after my family.

01:06:28.941 --> 01:06:30.682
- They came at Dad.
- I know.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:23.159
Enjoying the meal?

01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:27.424

01:09:27.467 --> 01:09:28.860
Cute.

01:09:36.259 --> 01:09:40.437
You have some nerve
to be here like this.

01:09:41.612 --> 01:09:44.223
Yeah. Maybe.

01:09:59.325 --> 01:10:01.675
What say you and I
have a moment?

01:10:27.135 --> 01:10:29.312
Now, on the one hand,

01:10:29.355 --> 01:10:32.880
there's a long-dormant
piece of me now awake

01:10:32.924 --> 01:10:36.406
that wants so very badly
to play this out.

01:10:37.798 --> 01:10:39.670
The other,
more reasonable piece of me...

01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:41.585
what's left of it...

01:10:41.628 --> 01:10:43.717
would like to end our little
tête-à-tête right now.

01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:45.545
What's done is done.

01:10:45.589 --> 01:10:47.721
After all,
we can both rebuild, right?

01:10:47.765 --> 01:10:49.941
Right.

01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:52.726
Mm, wait. Rebuild?

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:55.555
I burned it... all of it.

01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:57.731
What all?

01:10:57.775 --> 01:10:59.429
Everything you have.

01:10:59.472 --> 01:11:01.300
Had.

01:11:01.344 --> 01:11:03.389

01:11:04.782 --> 01:11:06.610

01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:10.875
Obshak!

01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:12.442
You should've seen it go up.

01:11:12.485 --> 01:11:14.748
It was something.

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:17.490
I mean, if this doesn't
make us even...

01:11:17.534 --> 01:11:19.840
because, after all,
you came to my house,

01:11:19.884 --> 01:11:24.541
which you know
you don't fucking do!

01:11:27.674 --> 01:11:29.894
You killed my brother.

01:11:29.937 --> 01:11:32.375
The last I saw,
he was still breathing.

01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:34.812
And based on what little
I know of the man,

01:11:34.855 --> 01:11:37.249
that's probably more
than he deserved.

01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:45.301
Now...

01:11:45.344 --> 01:11:47.738
you can come after me,

01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:49.914
and if you succeed
in taking me down,

01:11:49.957 --> 01:11:55.136
well, you're still obligated
to refinance the entire Obshak,

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.138
which begs the question...
can you?

01:11:57.182 --> 01:11:58.879
Do you even want to?

01:11:58.923 --> 01:12:01.752
'Cause I've heard
that you want out.

01:12:03.841 --> 01:12:07.584

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:09.716

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.718

I mean, besides from what's
still smoldering.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.027
So, hmm?

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.811
Get some work done.

01:12:17.855 --> 01:12:20.161

01:12:20.205 --> 01:12:22.903

Caribbean islands

01:12:22.947 --> 01:12:26.733

Had you just stolen the Obshak,

01:21:16.697 --> 01:21:19.700
we could have found a way out,

but glorious.

01:22:42.218 --> 01:22:44.960

01:22:45.003 --> 01:22:48.050

01:23:45.107 --> 01:23:47.152

I'm nobody.

01:24:23.449 --> 01:24:26.235
- Mm.
- That ain't much of an answer.

01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:30.674
Trust me, it's answer enough.

01:24:30.717 --> 01:24:32.197

the beautiful dining room.

01:25:15.936 --> 01:25:17.590
The walls used to be
a lot darker,

01:25:17.634 --> 01:25:20.680

to have a brighter look.

Oh, baby, look at the light.

01:25:25.032 --> 01:25:28.079
And as you can see,
the previous owners were foodies

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:30.995
who valued the kitchen
above all else.

01:25:31.038 --> 01:25:32.344

01:25:32.388 --> 01:25:34.651

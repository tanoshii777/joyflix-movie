"In order to affect a timely halt
to deteriorating conditions

01:02.589 --> 01:05.183
and to ensure the common good,

a state of emergency is declared

By decree, according to martial law,

suspended.

convicted of piracy...

hang by the neck until dead."

A dangerous song to be singing...

05:54.681 --> 05:57.411
...for any who are
ignorant of its meaning.

05:58.018 --> 05:59.918
Particularly a woman.

06:01.488 --> 06:03.854
Particularly a woman alone.

06:04.624 --> 06:06.819
What makes you think
she's alone?

06:11.431 --> 06:12.921
You protect her?

06:13.900 --> 06:16.300
And what makes you think
I need protecting?

06:16.703 --> 06:19.001
Your master's expecting us.

06:19.072 --> 06:23.441
And an unexpected death'd
cast a slight pall on our meeting.

06:25.045 --> 06:26.478
Pick those feet up!

06:28.415 --> 06:30.144
On the double!

06:31.551 --> 06:33.382
Eyes front!

06:42.229 --> 06:43.856
No, no, no. None.

07:11.992 --> 07:14.688
it always takes me
about a week to get my sea legs.

07:14.761 --> 07:16.922
I was throwing up horribly
the last time.

07:28.275 --> 07:31.335
Steady as she goes.

07:33.713 --> 07:34.702
All right.

07:38.418 --> 07:40.318
Have you heard anything from Will?

07:40.387 --> 07:42.719
I trust young Turner
to acquire the charts

07:42.789 --> 07:46.225
and you to remember your place
in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.819
Is he that terrifying?

07:48.895 --> 07:53.832
He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.

08:08.848 --> 08:11.442
We're through. Make ready.

08:17.958 --> 08:19.152
Hurry now.

08:25.565 --> 08:29.433
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

08:31.771 --> 08:33.796
Well, when you put it that way...

08:34.474 --> 08:36.271
Remove. Please.

09:21.121 --> 09:24.147
Remove. Please.

10:09.402 --> 10:13.668
Captain Barbossa,
welcome to Singapore.

10:18.244 --> 10:19.370
More steam.

10:41.935 --> 10:42.924
None of that.

10:43.002 --> 10:46.961
If things don't go the way we want,
then we're the only chance they've got.

10:53.246 --> 10:57.842
I understand that you have
a request to make of me.

10:57.917 --> 11:00.977
More of a proposal to put to ye.

11:01.387 --> 11:06.791
I've a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

11:07.827 --> 11:11.627
Hmm. It's an odd coincidence.

11:11.698 --> 11:14.792
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?

11:14.868 --> 11:17.268
No.

11:17.337 --> 11:19.965
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

11:20.039 --> 11:23.998
a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

11:24.144 --> 11:27.170
and tried to make off with these.

11:28.815 --> 11:31.511
The navigational charts.

11:32.152 --> 11:35.883
The route to the Farthest Gate.

11:38.391 --> 11:42.851
Wouldn't it be amazing
if this venture of yours

11:42.929 --> 11:46.330
took you to the world beyond this one?

11:46.399 --> 11:49.266
It would strain credulity at that.

12:03.316 --> 12:08.015
This is the thief.
Is his face familiar to you?

12:10.824 --> 12:14.260
Then I guess he has
no further need for it.

12:14.594 --> 12:15.583
No, no!

12:24.504 --> 12:29.407
You come into my city
and you betray my hospitality.

12:30.276 --> 12:33.768
- I assure you I had no idea...
- That he would get caught!

12:38.184 --> 12:41.347
You intend to attempt the voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

12:41.421 --> 12:43.753
But I cannot help but wonder...

12:45.425 --> 12:46.790
Why?

12:56.236 --> 13:01.970
The song has been sung.
The time is upon us.

13:02.475 --> 13:06.241
We must convene the Brethren Court.

13:06.312 --> 13:12.273
As one of the nine pirate lords,
you must honor the call.

13:14.153 --> 13:15.313
More steam.

13:22.295 --> 13:23.819
More steam!

13:30.937 --> 13:34.429
- There is a price on all our heads.
- Aye.

13:34.507 --> 13:36.407
It is true.

13:36.476 --> 13:39.741
It seems the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore...

13:41.381 --> 13:44.782
...is by betraying other pirates.

13:44.851 --> 13:47.217
We must put
our differences aside.

13:47.287 --> 13:48.345
Wait for the signal.

13:48.421 --> 13:51.584
The First Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.

13:51.658 --> 13:56.322
But now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett.

13:56.462 --> 13:59.192
Against East India
Trading Company,

13:59.265 --> 14:01.927
what value is the Brethren Court?

14:02.602 --> 14:04.433
What can any of us do?

14:04.504 --> 14:07.337
You can fight!
Get off me!

14:07.407 --> 14:10.865
You are Sao Feng,
the pirate lord of Singapore.

14:10.944 --> 14:15.643
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.

14:16.149 --> 14:19.585
Where waves aren't measured in feet,
but as increments of fear,

14:19.652 --> 14:21.916
and those who pass the test
become legend.

14:22.555 --> 14:25.353
Would you have that era
come to an end on your watch?

14:25.892 --> 14:28.554
The most notorious pirates
from around the world

14:28.628 --> 14:30.619
are uniting against our enemy,

14:30.697 --> 14:33.791
and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!

14:39.238 --> 14:41.138
Elizabeth Swann.

14:41.674 --> 14:45.371
There is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

14:46.145 --> 14:50.104
And the eye does not go wanting.

14:51.651 --> 14:57.021
But I cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.

14:58.358 --> 15:01.759
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?

15:01.828 --> 15:03.022
Jack Sparrow.

15:06.065 --> 15:08.124
He's one of the pirate lords.

15:14.007 --> 15:15.497
The only reason...

15:16.509 --> 15:20.536
...I would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead...

15:21.247 --> 15:24.580
...is so I can send him back myself!

15:29.055 --> 15:33.287
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.

15:33.359 --> 15:36.817
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.

15:36.896 --> 15:39.524
So we must go and get him back.

15:44.737 --> 15:48.070
So you admit...

15:48.408 --> 15:50.672
...you have deceived me.

15:50.743 --> 15:52.142
Weapons!

15:55.348 --> 15:56.542
Weapons.

15:57.216 --> 16:01.209
Sao Feng, I assure you,
our intentions are strictly honorable.

16:08.327 --> 16:11.228
Drop your weapons or I kill the man!

16:13.666 --> 16:15.463
Kill him. He's not our man.

16:17.537 --> 16:20.438
If he's not with you,
and he's not with us...

16:21.107 --> 16:23.007
...who's he with?

16:23.076 --> 16:25.476
Charge!

16:46.332 --> 16:47.321
Will!

17:01.714 --> 17:04.239
Look out! Look behind you!

17:07.220 --> 17:08.482
Ready!

17:10.056 --> 17:11.045
Fire.

17:20.867 --> 17:21.856
Chart!

17:47.527 --> 17:48.551
Boo!

17:52.899 --> 17:57.529
Company! Make ready. Set. Fire!

18:04.510 --> 18:05.499
Company!

18:05.578 --> 18:07.671
Make ready. Set.

18:10.616 --> 18:12.811
Fire!

18:28.634 --> 18:31.068
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

18:31.137 --> 18:36.074
The East India Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.

18:36.142 --> 18:37.575
It is coincidence only.

18:41.314 --> 18:45.182
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.

18:46.419 --> 18:50.913
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

18:51.357 --> 18:54.019
Why should I expect any better?

18:54.093 --> 18:56.960
I need the Black Pearl
to free my father.

19:00.233 --> 19:01.860
You're helping me to get it.

19:11.010 --> 19:12.443
Uh-oh.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.250
Fire in the hole.

19:37.436 --> 19:38.630
Thank you, Jack.

19:38.704 --> 19:40.797
Thank you, Jack.

19:43.042 --> 19:45.840
- You have the charts?
- And better yet.

19:46.479 --> 19:49.243
- A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?

19:49.315 --> 19:52.148
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

19:52.218 --> 19:54.049
This way. Be quick.

20:00.393 --> 20:03.089
Haul the snotters with a will!

20:03.162 --> 20:04.857
Keep it taut.

20:05.931 --> 20:08.923
Secure provisions
and stow the cargo.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.834
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

20:12.438 --> 20:14.804
Do you think he will honor the call?

20:15.374 --> 20:17.342
I cannot say.

20:18.210 --> 20:20.474
There's an evil on these seas

20:20.546 --> 20:25.882
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

21:32.985 --> 21:34.452
A piece of eight.

21:35.187 --> 21:36.916
Nine of them, you say.

21:36.989 --> 21:40.083
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

21:40.159 --> 21:41.751
Nine pieces of eight.

21:41.827 --> 21:44.387
What's the significance of that,
I wonder.

21:44.463 --> 21:46.795
Nothing can hold against the armada.

21:46.866 --> 21:49.096
Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.

21:49.168 --> 21:50.692
Nothing we know of.

21:52.071 --> 21:55.404
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

21:55.474 --> 21:58.204
He was mum on that, sir.

21:58.277 --> 21:59.744
Hmm.

21:59.812 --> 22:02.246
Then he knows the value of information.

22:02.314 --> 22:05.112
Better keep this between ourselves.

22:05.184 --> 22:08.483
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

22:10.356 --> 22:15.089
- Ah, admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

22:15.161 --> 22:17.891
Yes. Something for you there.

22:17.963 --> 22:21.330
Your new station deserves an old friend.

22:35.114 --> 22:38.447
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

22:38.517 --> 22:40.075
Execution.

22:45.958 --> 22:48.153
The Brethren know they face extinction.

22:49.161 --> 22:53.530
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

23:18.324 --> 23:21.521
No one said anything about cold.

23:21.594 --> 23:25.360
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

23:26.365 --> 23:29.300
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

23:29.368 --> 23:33.896
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

23:35.207 --> 23:39.473
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

23:39.545 --> 23:44.710
to a place not of death, but punishment.

23:44.783 --> 23:48.617
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

23:49.054 --> 23:51.284
...stretching on forever.

23:51.724 --> 23:55.216
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

23:59.398 --> 24:02.765
Yeah. I knew there was a good reason.

24:13.746 --> 24:16.010
Nothing here is set.

24:17.216 --> 24:19.377
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

24:19.451 --> 24:24.115
No. But it leads to more places.

24:30.195 --> 24:31.719
"Over the edge.

24:31.797 --> 24:34.231
Over again."

24:36.068 --> 24:38.764
"Sunrise sets.

24:38.837 --> 24:41.829
Flash of green."

24:42.708 --> 24:46.701
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

24:47.513 --> 24:52.382
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

24:52.451 --> 24:57.013
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

24:57.089 --> 25:00.889
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

25:01.293 --> 25:04.285
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

25:04.363 --> 25:07.196
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...

25:07.266 --> 25:11.430
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

25:16.008 --> 25:19.603
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

25:19.678 --> 25:23.011
It's not getting to the land
of the dead that's the problem.

25:25.250 --> 25:27.013
It's getting back.

26:07.559 --> 26:07.660
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

26:07.660 --> 26:12.256
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

26:12.331 --> 26:13.559
Aye, aye, sir!

26:15.734 --> 26:18.828
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

26:18.904 --> 26:22.271
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

26:22.741 --> 26:24.709
Fetch the chest.

26:25.411 --> 26:27.572
And the governor?

26:28.347 --> 26:32.113
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

26:32.685 --> 26:34.516
Does he know?

26:38.090 --> 26:41.753
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

27:41.987 --> 27:44.012
Step lively, men.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.014
Step lively!

27:48.093 --> 27:49.287
Stand fast!

27:56.001 --> 27:57.696
Steady, men.

28:03.475 --> 28:09.345
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

28:09.414 --> 28:12.383
I will not have it on my ship!

28:12.451 --> 28:15.978
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that...
because I will.

28:16.054 --> 28:18.955
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

28:19.024 --> 28:22.425
that this ship do as directed
by the company.

28:27.633 --> 28:30.067
We need prisoners to interrogate,

28:30.135 --> 28:33.332
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

28:33.405 --> 28:37.307
The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.

28:37.376 --> 28:41.278
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.

28:43.882 --> 28:47.978
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

28:48.954 --> 28:52.651
This is no longer your world, Jones.

28:53.492 --> 28:56.859
The immaterial has become...

28:57.996 --> 28:59.725
...immaterial.

29:00.833 --> 29:02.926
Charge your bayonets.

29:41.907 --> 29:44.307
How long do we continue not talking?

29:48.313 --> 29:50.838
Once we rescue Jack,
everything'll be fine.

29:53.952 --> 29:55.385
Then we rescue Jack.

30:20.679 --> 30:23.876
For what we want most...

30:25.884 --> 30:29.183
...there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

30:40.465 --> 30:45.402
- Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.

30:46.305 --> 30:48.933
- Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost

30:49.007 --> 30:50.998
to find a place as can't be found.

30:51.076 --> 30:53.442
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.

30:53.712 --> 30:56.180
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

30:57.182 --> 30:58.774
To stations!

30:59.885 --> 31:01.284
All hands to stations!

31:01.353 --> 31:04.117
Huh?

31:04.189 --> 31:07.090
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

31:07.159 --> 31:11.994
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

31:13.899 --> 31:15.127
Blimey.

31:29.147 --> 31:32.514
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

31:32.584 --> 31:35.246
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

31:35.320 --> 31:39.154
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

31:43.929 --> 31:45.157
Tie her off.

31:50.836 --> 31:52.531
Hard aport.

32:01.279 --> 32:03.304
Hold on!

32:35.247 --> 32:39.877
Strike your colors,
you blooming cockroaches.

32:39.951 --> 32:45.480
Dead men tell no tales.

33:33.672 --> 33:35.105
My peanut.

33:36.708 --> 33:38.767
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

33:38.844 --> 33:41.142
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

33:41.213 --> 33:43.340
Step lively with a will.

33:43.415 --> 33:45.007
- Aye, aye.
- Right away, sir.

33:45.083 --> 33:46.778
I want a fire down below!

33:49.888 --> 33:53.619
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

34:04.603 --> 34:08.403
Haul! Haul!

34:08.473 --> 34:11.340
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.

34:11.409 --> 34:13.206
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

34:27.225 --> 34:29.193
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n.

34:29.961 --> 34:32.691
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

34:33.398 --> 34:36.834
- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

34:36.902 --> 34:40.770
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

34:40.839 --> 34:43.273
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

34:43.341 --> 34:46.868
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

34:47.279 --> 34:49.213
Shall I?

34:53.185 --> 34:56.245
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

34:58.990 --> 35:01.857
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

35:01.927 --> 35:06.159
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

35:06.231 --> 35:08.028
Do you understand?

35:08.099 --> 35:11.227
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

35:11.770 --> 35:14.967
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.508
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

35:17.576 --> 35:21.068
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

35:21.146 --> 35:24.115
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

35:24.182 --> 35:27.083
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

35:29.888 --> 35:33.881
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

35:44.436 --> 35:45.835
No wind.

35:46.338 --> 35:48.306
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

35:49.941 --> 35:52.409
My soul I do swear for a breeze.

35:52.477 --> 35:57.312
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

36:10.095 --> 36:12.586
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

36:12.664 --> 36:14.359
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

36:14.432 --> 36:18.129
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

36:31.383 --> 36:32.816
Shoo.

36:51.836 --> 36:53.098
A rock.

37:20.398 --> 37:23.959
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

37:24.269 --> 37:25.258
Oh.

37:26.738 --> 37:28.296
A rope.

39:49.013 --> 39:52.107
This truly is a godforsaken place.

39:52.884 --> 39:55.944
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.

39:57.288 --> 39:58.915
He's here.

39:58.990 --> 40:02.289
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.793
And does it matter?

40:03.862 --> 40:06.922
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

40:10.101 --> 40:15.266
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.438
Impossible.

41:03.087 --> 41:04.076
Boat.

41:10.461 --> 41:14.363
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.

41:23.508 --> 41:26.204
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

41:26.277 --> 41:27.369
Hide the rum.

41:27.445 --> 41:29.379
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n.

41:29.447 --> 41:30.812
I thought so.

41:30.882 --> 41:33.851
I expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

41:33.918 --> 41:34.907
Sir?

41:34.986 --> 41:39.013
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

41:39.090 --> 41:41.422
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

41:42.260 --> 41:45.058
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.

41:48.766 --> 41:52.065
I know that.
I know where I am.

41:52.136 --> 41:56.368
- And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.

41:57.075 --> 41:58.940
Oh, Hector.

41:59.010 --> 42:00.944
It's been too long. Hasn't it?

42:01.012 --> 42:05.813
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

42:07.218 --> 42:09.083
No, I didn't.

42:09.153 --> 42:11.246
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

42:11.322 --> 42:15.224
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

42:16.561 --> 42:18.461
He thinks we're a hallucination.

42:19.364 --> 42:21.025
William, tell me something:

42:21.099 --> 42:25.126
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

42:25.203 --> 42:28.764
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.

42:29.307 --> 42:30.296
No.

42:30.375 --> 42:32.809
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

42:32.877 --> 42:36.870
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

42:36.948 --> 42:38.313
Jack.

42:40.485 --> 42:42.419
This is real. We're here.

42:53.398 --> 42:56.060
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

42:56.501 --> 42:58.799
We've come to rescue you.

43:00.405 --> 43:03.932
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

43:04.008 --> 43:07.341
But it would seem that
as I possess a ship and you don't,

43:07.478 --> 43:11.574
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

43:12.417 --> 43:15.944
I see my ship. Right there.

43:19.457 --> 43:20.981
Can't spot it.

43:21.059 --> 43:24.392
Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.

43:24.462 --> 43:27.260
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

43:27.331 --> 43:30.698
- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.

43:30.768 --> 43:33.635
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

43:33.705 --> 43:37.505
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

43:37.575 --> 43:40.237
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

43:40.311 --> 43:42.108
And you need a crew.

43:44.215 --> 43:46.410
Why should I sail with any of you?

43:46.484 --> 43:49.976
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

43:53.725 --> 43:57.161
Oh, she's not told you.

43:57.228 --> 44:00.061
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

44:01.432 --> 44:02.899
As for you...

44:04.135 --> 44:10.005
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

44:10.975 --> 44:13.034
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

44:13.111 --> 44:15.045
Don't need you. You scare me.

44:15.113 --> 44:18.981
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...

44:19.050 --> 44:20.711
Cotton.

44:20.785 --> 44:25.313
Cottors parrot, I'm a little iffy, but
at least I'll have someone to talk to.

44:26.491 --> 44:27.788
Who are you?

44:27.859 --> 44:30.157
Tai Huang. These are my men.

44:30.828 --> 44:34.662
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

44:35.099 --> 44:38.762
- I have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

44:38.836 --> 44:42.863
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

44:42.940 --> 44:44.134
Weigh anchor.

44:47.712 --> 44:49.304
Jack...

44:50.648 --> 44:54.243
Which way are you going, Jack?

44:56.387 --> 44:59.686
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

44:59.757 --> 45:02.317
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.

45:02.393 --> 45:03.826
What are you doing?

45:03.895 --> 45:06.489
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

45:06.564 --> 45:09.328
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

45:09.400 --> 45:11.891
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

45:11.969 --> 45:14.130
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

45:14.705 --> 45:17.697
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

45:17.775 --> 45:20.266
That makes you "chartman."

45:20.344 --> 45:25.247
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

45:31.088 --> 45:34.285
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

45:34.358 --> 45:37.293
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

45:37.361 --> 45:38.623
Sorry.

45:43.367 --> 45:45.665
- I'd vote for you.
- Yeah?

46:21.072 --> 46:22.937
You left Jack to the Kraken.

46:24.008 --> 46:26.135
He's rescued now. It's done with.

46:29.313 --> 46:31.281
Will, I had no choice.

46:32.516 --> 46:34.381
You chose not to tell me.

46:35.319 --> 46:37.048
I couldn't.

46:38.389 --> 46:39.981
It wasn't your burden to bear.

46:40.992 --> 46:42.857
But I did bear it, didn't I?

46:44.562 --> 46:46.427
I just didn't know what it was.

46:47.231 --> 46:48.858
I thought...

46:50.034 --> 46:52.025
You thought I loved him.

47:00.544 --> 47:04.378
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

47:07.385 --> 47:08.682
You can't.

47:37.248 --> 47:38.408
Eerie.

47:40.184 --> 47:42.345
That's downright macabre.

47:47.892 --> 47:51.555
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?

48:01.472 --> 48:03.667
Be disrespectful, it would.

48:03.741 --> 48:07.507
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

48:09.146 --> 48:12.309
That was the duty
him was charged with...

48:12.616 --> 48:15.312
...by the goddess, Calypso.

48:17.188 --> 48:20.988
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

48:24.295 --> 48:26.263
And every ten years...

48:27.064 --> 48:29.191
...him could come ashore...

48:30.234 --> 48:34.534
...to be with she
who love him... truly.

48:38.876 --> 48:41.470
But the man has become a monster.

48:42.079 --> 48:46.106
So he wasn't always... tentacley?

48:48.219 --> 48:49.379
No.

48:51.589 --> 48:53.989
Him was a man...

48:54.058 --> 48:56.049
...once.

49:03.367 --> 49:05.392
Now there's boats coming.

49:13.077 --> 49:15.841
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?

49:16.447 --> 49:19.041
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

49:19.116 --> 49:21.380
It's best just let them be.

49:35.866 --> 49:38.334
It's my father. We've made it back.

49:38.402 --> 49:40.962
Father! Father, here, look here!

49:42.773 --> 49:43.865
Elizabeth.

49:45.810 --> 49:47.334
We're not back.

49:54.452 --> 49:55.476
Father!

49:58.756 --> 50:02.248
Elizabeth. Are you dead?

50:03.494 --> 50:04.825
No. No.

50:05.830 --> 50:07.525
I think I am.

50:07.598 --> 50:09.589
No, you can't be.

50:10.734 --> 50:13.601
There was this chest, you see.

50:14.371 --> 50:18.034
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

50:18.709 --> 50:19.937
Come aboard.

50:20.010 --> 50:21.773
And a heart.

50:21.846 --> 50:27.113
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.

50:27.184 --> 50:30.711
And you will sail the seas for eternity.

50:30.788 --> 50:33.780
The Dutchman must have a captain.

50:34.859 --> 50:36.850
Silly thing to die for.

50:37.228 --> 50:40.459
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

50:42.299 --> 50:43.391
Come on.

50:44.468 --> 50:48.700
A touch... of destiny.

50:51.575 --> 50:52.872
Take the line.

50:55.379 --> 50:57.574
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

50:57.648 --> 50:59.377
Father, the line! Take the line!

51:03.187 --> 51:05.519
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

51:05.589 --> 51:09.855
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave you!

51:10.494 --> 51:12.485
I'll give your love to your mother.

51:12.563 --> 51:15.430
- Please, I won't let you go!
- Elizabeth.

51:15.499 --> 51:17.558
Elizabeth.

51:23.674 --> 51:24.936
Is there a way?

51:29.747 --> 51:31.442
Him at peace.

51:38.856 --> 51:40.414
No water.

51:41.559 --> 51:43.652
Why is all but the rum gone?

51:45.296 --> 51:46.729
Rum's gone too.

51:54.905 --> 51:59.535
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

51:59.610 --> 52:03.512
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.

52:03.581 --> 52:06.812
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.

52:07.618 --> 52:08.710
Forever.

52:08.786 --> 52:12.745
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

52:13.324 --> 52:15.053
Why doesn't he do something?

52:15.459 --> 52:18.326
- Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

52:18.395 --> 52:22.729
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.

52:23.100 --> 52:27.764
"Over the edge." Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.

52:28.405 --> 52:30.373
Sunrises don't set.

52:34.878 --> 52:36.778
"Up is down."

52:36.847 --> 52:39.338
Well, that's just maddeningly un-helpful.

52:39.416 --> 52:41.384
Why are these things never clear?

52:41.452 --> 52:44.285
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

52:47.958 --> 52:50.449
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

52:50.527 --> 52:53.690
- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.

52:53.764 --> 52:56.289
That's even more
than less than un-helpful.

52:56.367 --> 52:59.131
Sail the seas for eternity.

52:59.203 --> 53:02.138
- I love the sea.
- What about port?

53:02.206 --> 53:04.197
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

53:04.275 --> 53:09.269
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

53:09.680 --> 53:13.275
- Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?

53:13.350 --> 53:16.808
- Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

53:16.887 --> 53:19.219
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

53:19.290 --> 53:21.554
But eternity is longer still.

53:22.293 --> 53:25.319
And how will you be spending it? Dead?

53:25.996 --> 53:27.395
Or not?

53:27.464 --> 53:31.332
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.

53:31.635 --> 53:33.967
Come sunset, it won't matter.

53:36.774 --> 53:38.469
Not sunset.

53:41.745 --> 53:42.939
Sundown.

53:43.914 --> 53:46.439
And rise. Up.

53:47.718 --> 53:48.912
What's that?

53:51.722 --> 53:54.850
What is that?
I don't know. What do you think?

53:54.925 --> 53:56.620
- Where?
- There.

54:18.415 --> 54:19.746
What is it?

54:31.795 --> 54:33.626
He's rocking the ship.

54:33.964 --> 54:35.591
We're rocking the ship.

54:39.703 --> 54:42.570
Aye. He's onto it.

54:44.875 --> 54:46.604
He's rocking the ship.

54:46.677 --> 54:49.077
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,

54:49.146 --> 54:51.808
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.

54:52.916 --> 54:54.440
Time it with the swell.

54:56.086 --> 54:59.783
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

55:01.525 --> 55:05.154
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.

56:10.127 --> 56:11.492
Now up...

56:13.063 --> 56:14.394
...is down.

57:50.394 --> 57:52.385
This was your idea.

57:53.964 --> 57:56.455
Blessed sweet westerlies!

57:57.601 --> 57:58.590
We're back!

58:02.406 --> 58:03.703
It's the sunrise.

58:16.853 --> 58:18.844
Parley?

58:18.922 --> 58:21.390
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!

58:36.840 --> 58:38.239
All right, then!

58:38.308 --> 58:41.436
The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.

58:41.511 --> 58:45.208
And, Jack, you and I are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.

58:45.282 --> 58:46.681
I is arguing the point.

58:46.750 --> 58:50.379
If there's pirates a-gathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

58:50.454 --> 58:53.890
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.

58:53.957 --> 58:56.255
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.

58:56.326 --> 58:59.352
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,

58:59.429 --> 59:01.056
till there be none left but you.

59:01.965 --> 59:07.426
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

59:07.504 --> 59:08.528
Aye.

59:09.039 --> 59:13.408
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?

59:13.477 --> 59:15.468
I'm still working on that.

59:15.545 --> 59:20.039
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.

59:25.722 --> 59:27.053
Wet powder.

59:29.793 --> 59:33.320
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!

59:35.332 --> 59:37.857
- Ow!
- Sorry. Effective, though.

59:38.969 --> 59:40.994
There's fresh water on this island.

59:41.071 --> 59:44.700
We can re-supply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

59:45.008 --> 59:47.806
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

59:48.278 --> 59:50.712
I'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.

59:50.781 --> 59:54.410
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.

59:55.652 --> 59:56.983
Temporarily.

01:00:14.805 --> 01:00:16.363
Mind the boat.

01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:30.318
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!

01:00:49.339 --> 01:00:51.330
Careful! Careful!

01:00:52.876 --> 01:00:54.776
You stupid fish!

01:00:54.911 --> 01:00:56.879
Actually it's a cephalopod.

01:00:57.347 --> 01:00:58.541
Serves you right.

01:00:58.682 --> 01:01:01.674
Pin, I bet people
would pay a shilling to see this.

01:01:01.752 --> 01:01:04.915
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

01:01:04.988 --> 01:01:08.014
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

01:01:08.091 --> 01:01:10.924
We could serve up
a slice as a souvenir.

01:01:10.994 --> 01:01:13.588
Still thinking of running, Jack?

01:01:14.364 --> 01:01:16.855
Think you can outrun the world?

01:01:22.539 --> 01:01:26.373
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...

01:01:26.443 --> 01:01:29.139
...by and by, there be none left at all.

01:01:30.547 --> 01:01:35.541
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.

01:01:35.619 --> 01:01:38.747
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

01:01:39.456 --> 01:01:42.118
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.

01:01:42.626 --> 01:01:45.288
But passing on, that's dead certain.

01:01:48.665 --> 01:01:51.657
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

01:01:51.735 --> 01:01:53.464
It's our only hope, lad.

01:01:54.871 --> 01:01:57.863
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

01:01:59.509 --> 01:02:02.171
The world used to be a bigger place.

01:02:04.848 --> 01:02:06.748
The world's still the same.

01:02:08.685 --> 01:02:11.449
There's just... less in it.

01:02:33.743 --> 01:02:36.075
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

01:02:38.882 --> 01:02:42.682
Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!

01:02:42.752 --> 01:02:44.743
- Singapore.
- Captain!

01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:48.683
Hoy!

01:02:49.759 --> 01:02:51.556
We got company!

01:03:03.039 --> 01:03:04.734
He's the captain.

01:03:15.185 --> 01:03:16.482
Sao Feng...

01:03:16.553 --> 01:03:21.047
...you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.487
Jack Sparrow.

01:03:27.464 --> 01:03:29.557
You paid me great insult once.

01:03:29.633 --> 01:03:31.123
That doesn't sound like me.

01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:38.200
Shall we just call it square, then?

01:03:38.742 --> 01:03:39.902
Release her.

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:44.544
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

01:03:45.415 --> 01:03:47.406
You heard Captain Turner.

01:03:48.952 --> 01:03:51.546
- Release her!
- "Captain Turner"?

01:03:51.621 --> 01:03:54.385
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

01:03:54.457 --> 01:03:57.017
I need the Pearl to free my father.

01:03:57.093 --> 01:03:59.584
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:02.963
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

01:04:03.033 --> 01:04:05.228
It was my burden to bear.

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:11.770
He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.

01:04:11.841 --> 01:04:15.902
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

01:04:16.947 --> 01:04:19.882
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

01:04:29.092 --> 01:04:30.559
I'm standing with them.

01:04:32.729 --> 01:04:38.395
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

01:04:38.468 --> 01:04:42.097
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

01:04:44.507 --> 01:04:46.737
Here is your chance to find out.

01:04:56.152 --> 01:04:57.813
Curious.

01:04:57.887 --> 01:05:01.050
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

01:05:01.124 --> 01:05:05.652
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

01:05:05.729 --> 01:05:07.697
can defeat the Flying Dutchman.

01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:11.867
And so despair leads to betrayal.

01:05:12.268 --> 01:05:16.261
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

01:05:19.042 --> 01:05:20.532
It's not here, Jack.

01:05:21.945 --> 01:05:23.344
What? What isn't?

01:05:23.413 --> 01:05:27.907
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,

01:05:27.984 --> 01:05:31.010
and so unavailable for use as leverage

01:05:31.087 --> 01:05:33.749
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

01:05:33.823 --> 01:05:37.088
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

01:05:37.227 --> 01:05:39.286
By your death?

01:05:39.362 --> 01:05:41.421
And yet here you are.

01:05:41.965 --> 01:05:44.593
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:46.100
That's how I get by.

01:05:47.003 --> 01:05:50.632
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

01:05:51.241 --> 01:05:52.708
Ship oars.

01:05:52.776 --> 01:05:54.334
Ship oars.

01:05:54.644 --> 01:05:56.236
Be on your guard, men.

01:05:58.882 --> 01:06:00.747
My men are crew enough.

01:06:00.817 --> 01:06:02.978
Company ship, company crew.

01:06:04.054 --> 01:06:06.955
You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.

01:06:07.857 --> 01:06:09.256
And so it was.

01:06:12.328 --> 01:06:15.388
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

01:06:15.465 --> 01:06:20.698
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

01:06:27.143 --> 01:06:31.842
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?

01:06:32.916 --> 01:06:34.975
Square my debt with Jones...

01:06:36.019 --> 01:06:37.884
...guarantee my freedom?

01:06:37.954 --> 01:06:39.581
Of course.

01:06:39.656 --> 01:06:41.590
It's just good business.

01:06:42.659 --> 01:06:47.460
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:49.725
Everything.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.497
Where are they meeting?

01:06:52.302 --> 01:06:54.293
Who are the pirate lords?

01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:58.468
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

01:06:59.109 --> 01:07:02.237
Prepare the brig.

01:07:04.914 --> 01:07:09.817
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.

01:07:09.886 --> 01:07:13.549
He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?

01:07:20.697 --> 01:07:25.066
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

01:07:25.135 --> 01:07:28.366
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

01:07:29.038 --> 01:07:32.235
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.

01:07:32.308 --> 01:07:36.836
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

01:07:36.913 --> 01:07:40.781
- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.

01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:42.340
Now the Pearl!

01:07:43.353 --> 01:07:45.287
And what do the Brethren have?

01:07:45.989 --> 01:07:49.049
We have Calypso.

01:07:56.833 --> 01:07:59.199
Calypso.

01:08:01.271 --> 01:08:03.262
An old legend.

01:08:04.407 --> 01:08:09.344
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

01:08:09.779 --> 01:08:15.046
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

01:08:15.118 --> 01:08:20.420
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:24.384
All the Court.

01:08:26.262 --> 01:08:27.957
You can keep Barbossa.

01:08:28.031 --> 01:08:32.092
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

01:08:32.168 --> 01:08:34.693
And Turner. Especially Turner.

01:08:34.771 --> 01:08:38.229
The rest go with me on the Pearl.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

01:08:38.308 --> 01:08:42.642
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

01:08:42.712 --> 01:08:47.240
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

01:08:49.986 --> 01:08:52.113
What interest is she to you?

01:08:54.657 --> 01:08:57.023
What are you proposing, captain?

01:08:57.093 --> 01:09:00.085
What be accepting, cap'n?

01:09:01.564 --> 01:09:03.930
- The girl.
- What?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.558
Jack.

01:09:06.236 --> 01:09:08.033
I've just recalled.

01:09:08.104 --> 01:09:13.098
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.

01:09:13.643 --> 01:09:15.907
So for what do I need you?

01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:18.004
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

01:09:18.815 --> 01:09:20.146
Out of the question.

01:09:20.216 --> 01:09:22.013
It was not a question.

01:09:22.085 --> 01:09:23.848
Points to the thing you want most.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.115
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:29.420
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.521
- Dead.
- Done.

01:09:32.595 --> 01:09:35.257
What? Not done.

01:09:35.331 --> 01:09:37.891
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!

01:09:37.967 --> 01:09:39.059
Damn.

01:09:43.273 --> 01:09:47.039
Although, if I kill you,
then I can use the compass

01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:51.604
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

01:09:51.948 --> 01:09:54.314
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

01:09:54.384 --> 01:09:56.113
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

01:09:56.185 --> 01:09:59.677
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:02.656
Then we have an accord?

01:10:04.527 --> 01:10:07.087
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

01:10:07.163 --> 01:10:10.360
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

01:10:10.433 --> 01:10:13.368
...able to withstand blockade for years.

01:10:13.436 --> 01:10:17.998
Then you'd be wishing, "If only there
was someone I had not killed inside

01:10:18.141 --> 01:10:21.577
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

01:10:22.445 --> 01:10:24.345
And you can accomplish all this?

01:10:25.648 --> 01:10:28.708
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

01:10:29.052 --> 01:10:30.110
Who am I?

01:10:32.422 --> 01:10:34.117
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.120
Done!

01:11:12.395 --> 01:11:13.555
Man overboard!

01:11:27.643 --> 01:11:28.837
You're mad.

01:11:29.145 --> 01:11:32.376
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.

01:11:50.066 --> 01:11:53.229
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

01:12:00.743 --> 01:12:05.510
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:09.411
Which ship do we follow?

01:12:09.485 --> 01:12:14.149
Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.

01:12:15.124 --> 01:12:17.649
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:21.827
She's going down!

01:12:21.898 --> 01:12:23.422
Stand clear!

01:12:27.537 --> 01:12:32.440
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:35.299
Sir.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.716
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

01:13:26.262 --> 01:13:27.661
Calypso.

01:13:28.764 --> 01:13:30.231
Excuse me?

01:13:31.267 --> 01:13:35.363
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have...

01:13:35.938 --> 01:13:37.565
...but it is what we call you.

01:13:39.475 --> 01:13:40.669
We being who?

01:13:45.414 --> 01:13:47.211
You confirm it.

01:13:48.584 --> 01:13:49.983
Confirm what?

01:13:51.254 --> 01:13:55.850
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

01:13:55.925 --> 01:14:00.521
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.

01:14:01.631 --> 01:14:03.531
They bound you to human form

01:14:03.599 --> 01:14:07.057
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...

01:14:07.136 --> 01:14:08.899
To me.

01:14:11.474 --> 01:14:16.343
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

01:14:16.412 --> 01:14:19.006
Pretty speech from a captor.

01:14:19.081 --> 01:14:23.074
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

01:14:23.419 --> 01:14:26.411
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

01:14:28.391 --> 01:14:32.657
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

01:14:32.728 --> 01:14:36.528
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

01:14:37.567 --> 01:14:40.092
I offer simply my desire.

01:14:41.571 --> 01:14:43.061
And in return?

01:14:44.173 --> 01:14:48.109
I would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

01:14:52.181 --> 01:14:56.174
And if I should choose not?

01:14:57.687 --> 01:14:59.655
Then I will take...

01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:02.014
...your fury.

01:15:27.817 --> 01:15:29.114
Sao Feng?

01:15:30.686 --> 01:15:31.812
Here.

01:15:32.221 --> 01:15:33.688
Please.

01:15:39.562 --> 01:15:43.089
With all nine pieces of eight...

01:15:45.568 --> 01:15:47.627
...you will be free.

01:15:49.472 --> 01:15:50.598
Take it!

01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:54.272
You are captain now.

01:15:55.444 --> 01:15:56.468
Me?

01:15:59.115 --> 01:16:03.711
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

01:16:05.788 --> 01:16:08.382
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

01:16:09.825 --> 01:16:13.386
Forgive me... Calypso.

01:16:22.638 --> 01:16:23.730
Sao.

01:16:28.844 --> 01:16:30.539
What did he tell you?

01:16:35.618 --> 01:16:37.483
He made me captain.

01:16:39.755 --> 01:16:41.985
Set! Fire!

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:49.455
You are not my captain.

01:16:49.732 --> 01:16:51.063
Elizabeth.

01:16:51.934 --> 01:16:53.492
James. James.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.208
Thank God, you're alive.

01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:02.468
Your father'll be overjoyed

01:17:02.545 --> 01:17:05.378
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

01:17:05.848 --> 01:17:08.578
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

01:17:09.585 --> 01:17:11.519
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

01:17:12.822 --> 01:17:15.586
Who among you
do you name as captain?

01:17:15.658 --> 01:17:17.148
Captain. Her.

01:17:17.226 --> 01:17:18.887
Her.

01:17:21.764 --> 01:17:22.856
Captain?

01:17:22.932 --> 01:17:26.595
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

01:17:27.903 --> 01:17:29.871
The captain shall have my quarters.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.907
Thank you, sir.

01:17:32.975 --> 01:17:36.706
- But I prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.

01:17:36.779 --> 01:17:38.269
I swear.

01:17:39.215 --> 01:17:40.273
I did not know.

01:17:40.349 --> 01:17:44.479
Know what?
Which side you chose?

01:17:52.495 --> 01:17:54.258
Well, now you do.

01:18:02.938 --> 01:18:03.927
Bootstrap?

01:18:12.548 --> 01:18:13.845
Bootstrap.

01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:15.578
Bill Turner?

01:18:16.719 --> 01:18:17.845
Bootstrap.

01:18:27.029 --> 01:18:28.929
You know my name.

01:18:32.434 --> 01:18:33.799
Yes, I know your son.

01:18:35.871 --> 01:18:37.395
Will Turner.

01:18:38.841 --> 01:18:39.933
William.

01:18:45.815 --> 01:18:48.306
He made it. He's alive.

01:18:48.384 --> 01:18:52.616
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:56.956
God's wounds. He's on his way.

01:18:57.026 --> 01:18:58.391
Yes, Will is alive.

01:18:59.829 --> 01:19:01.387
And he wants to help you.

01:19:06.869 --> 01:19:10.498
He can't help me. He won't come.

01:19:11.273 --> 01:19:12.831
But you're his father.

01:19:13.676 --> 01:19:15.439
I know you.

01:19:16.278 --> 01:19:17.836
He spoke of you.

01:19:19.815 --> 01:19:22.978
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

01:19:24.353 --> 01:19:25.377
Me?

01:19:26.922 --> 01:19:28.651
You're Elizabeth.

01:19:30.025 --> 01:19:31.492
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

01:19:33.295 --> 01:19:38.255
If Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.

01:19:38.834 --> 01:19:41.701
Captain... Forever.

01:19:44.573 --> 01:19:47.542
The Dutchman
must always have a captain.

01:19:48.244 --> 01:19:50.337
And if he saves me...

01:19:51.547 --> 01:19:53.412
...he loses you.

01:19:56.385 --> 01:19:57.477
I see.

01:19:59.455 --> 01:20:01.320
He won't pick me.

01:20:02.258 --> 01:20:04.419
I wouldn't pick me.

01:20:09.498 --> 01:20:11.022
Tell him not to come.

01:20:13.235 --> 01:20:15.362
Tell him to stay away.

01:20:16.672 --> 01:20:18.697
Tell him it's too late.

01:20:20.276 --> 01:20:22.540
I'm already a part of the ship...

01:20:24.613 --> 01:20:26.240
...and the crew.

01:20:28.417 --> 01:20:29.406
Bootstrap.

01:20:32.488 --> 01:20:34.388
You know my name.

01:20:35.291 --> 01:20:37.384
You know my name.

01:20:38.627 --> 01:20:40.458
Yes, I know your son.

01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:43.158
William.

01:20:45.768 --> 01:20:47.736
He's coming for me.

01:20:48.437 --> 01:20:49.927
Wait and see.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.371
You'll see.

01:20:53.776 --> 01:20:55.539
He promised.

01:21:11.961 --> 01:21:13.895
Swing her over.

01:21:15.097 --> 01:21:16.860
Ready those lines.

01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:29.770
Sir.

01:21:33.148 --> 01:21:35.013
A breadcrumb trail.

01:21:35.084 --> 01:21:39.418
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

01:21:39.488 --> 01:21:44.653
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

01:21:45.961 --> 01:21:49.954
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.064
We can only hope
to reach our destination

01:21:54.136 --> 01:21:56.161
before they run out of bodies.

01:22:09.818 --> 01:22:12.878
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

01:22:13.822 --> 01:22:17.223
William, do you notice anything?

01:22:18.894 --> 01:22:20.122
Rather...

01:22:20.529 --> 01:22:24.056
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:27.825
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

01:22:27.903 --> 01:22:29.370
Not as odd as this.

01:22:30.773 --> 01:22:33.241
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

01:22:33.308 --> 01:22:36.334
I said to myself, "Think like Jack."

01:22:36.712 --> 01:22:38.907
This is what you've arrived at?

01:22:38.981 --> 01:22:42.314
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

01:22:42.384 --> 01:22:44.215
...accomplish your own ends?

01:22:44.286 --> 01:22:46.083
It's like you don't know me at all.

01:22:49.391 --> 01:22:52.485
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

01:22:53.862 --> 01:22:55.193
Ah.

01:22:55.798 --> 01:22:58.323
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

01:23:01.703 --> 01:23:03.261
I'm losing her, Jack.

01:23:04.006 --> 01:23:07.942
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:12.107
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

01:23:12.648 --> 01:23:15.845
If I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

01:23:17.019 --> 01:23:18.987
...avoid the choice altogether.

01:23:19.822 --> 01:23:21.289
Change the facts.

01:23:22.357 --> 01:23:25.349
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

01:23:26.128 --> 01:23:27.459
Who?

01:23:31.733 --> 01:23:32.722
You?

01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:38.471
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.067
I slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,

01:23:42.144 --> 01:23:43.907
your father's free from his debt,

01:23:43.979 --> 01:23:46.709
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

01:23:46.782 --> 01:23:50.616
You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman...

01:23:50.686 --> 01:23:54.645
...forever?
- No, mate. I'm free forever.

01:23:54.723 --> 01:23:58.750
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

01:23:59.094 --> 01:24:01.153
You have to do the job though, Jack.

01:24:01.230 --> 01:24:04.290
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

01:24:04.933 --> 01:24:07.527
Or end up just like Jones.

01:24:09.605 --> 01:24:11.596
I don't have the face for tentacles.

01:24:13.442 --> 01:24:16.002
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?

01:24:20.015 --> 01:24:21.175
What's this for?

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:23.946
Think like me. It'll come to you.

01:24:37.199 --> 01:24:39.599
My regards to Davy Jones.

01:24:44.873 --> 01:24:46.340
I hate him.

01:24:50.913 --> 01:24:52.039
Come with me.

01:24:55.617 --> 01:24:56.845
Quickly.

01:25:05.894 --> 01:25:07.156
What are you doing?

01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:10.855
Choosing a side.

01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:39.349
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

01:25:39.428 --> 01:25:41.760
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.

01:25:43.098 --> 01:25:45.225
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

01:25:46.468 --> 01:25:49.266
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.

01:25:51.473 --> 01:25:54.465
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

01:25:58.013 --> 01:25:59.071
Come with us.

01:26:03.151 --> 01:26:04.846
James, come with me.

01:26:06.054 --> 01:26:07.954
Who goes there?

01:26:10.726 --> 01:26:12.660
Go. I will follow.

01:26:14.263 --> 01:26:15.924
You're lying.

01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:21.568
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...

01:26:23.939 --> 01:26:25.463
...but never joined.

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.675
Go, now.

01:26:39.655 --> 01:26:41.816
Back to your station, sailor.

01:26:43.659 --> 01:26:48.926
- No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.

01:26:48.997 --> 01:26:50.692
That's an order.

01:26:51.767 --> 01:26:54.429
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

01:26:54.503 --> 01:26:57.267
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...

01:26:57.339 --> 01:27:00.240
- Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.

01:27:00.309 --> 01:27:02.709
All hands, prisoner escape!

01:27:03.045 --> 01:27:05.275
- Belay that!
- James!

01:27:17.025 --> 01:27:19.118
Prisoner escape!

01:27:21.563 --> 01:27:23.224
James! No!

01:27:32.307 --> 01:27:35.105
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

01:27:35.177 --> 01:27:37.202
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.

01:27:40.415 --> 01:27:42.975
To the captain's cabin!

01:27:43.051 --> 01:27:45.042
Back to the ship.

01:27:47.022 --> 01:27:50.958
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

01:28:00.302 --> 01:28:02.361
I take that as a "no."

01:28:06.875 --> 01:28:08.399
Nice sword.

01:28:29.364 --> 01:28:34.392
The Dutchman is under my command.

01:28:36.905 --> 01:28:39.203
For now.

01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:57.040
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

01:28:57.117 --> 01:28:59.517
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.

01:28:59.586 --> 01:29:03.022
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

01:29:03.089 --> 01:29:05.523
You heard him. Step lively.

01:29:05.592 --> 01:29:07.924
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

01:29:07.994 --> 01:29:10.827
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

01:29:10.897 --> 01:29:12.125
Aye.

01:29:12.199 --> 01:29:16.329
I once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

01:29:16.403 --> 01:29:17.995
What'd you call him?

01:29:19.172 --> 01:29:20.400
Larry.

01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:27.079
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

01:29:27.147 --> 01:29:29.138
But we agreed on ends only.

01:29:29.216 --> 01:29:32.185
The means are mine to decide.

01:29:32.252 --> 01:29:34.743
Caution, Barbossa.

01:29:34.821 --> 01:29:39.053
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:42.959
Or what it mean if you fail me.

01:29:46.233 --> 01:29:49.100
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

01:29:49.169 --> 01:29:52.900
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

01:29:53.807 --> 01:29:56.332
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

01:29:56.877 --> 01:30:00.176
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

01:30:00.247 --> 01:30:02.442
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

01:30:04.284 --> 01:30:07.378
Take this fishwife to the brig.

01:30:09.222 --> 01:30:11.349
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

01:30:39.185 --> 01:30:43.178
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

01:30:43.256 --> 01:30:45.190
Apparently, you can.

01:30:45.725 --> 01:30:47.386
I believe you know each other.

01:30:52.253 --> 01:30:56.383
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?

01:30:56.457 --> 01:30:57.822
Not yours.

01:30:58.259 --> 01:30:59.453
His.

01:31:00.361 --> 01:31:02.488
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

01:31:03.598 --> 01:31:05.429
Sparrow?

01:31:06.868 --> 01:31:08.460
You didn't tell him.

01:31:08.536 --> 01:31:11.767
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the Black Pearl.

01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.441
What else have you not told me?

01:31:16.211 --> 01:31:20.204
There is an issue far more troublesome.

01:31:21.549 --> 01:31:25.144
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

01:31:27.789 --> 01:31:29.484
Not a person.

01:31:30.225 --> 01:31:31.283
A heathen god.

01:31:31.359 --> 01:31:34.886
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams

01:31:34.963 --> 01:31:38.296
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

01:31:38.366 --> 01:31:41.494
- The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.

01:31:42.403 --> 01:31:44.997
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

01:31:45.807 --> 01:31:47.604
No! They cannot!

01:31:47.675 --> 01:31:50.644
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.

01:31:50.712 --> 01:31:53.681
- That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?

01:31:56.217 --> 01:32:00.210
I showed them how to bind her.

01:32:00.288 --> 01:32:02.256
She could not be trusted.

01:32:02.323 --> 01:32:04.154
I... She gave me no choice.

01:32:04.726 --> 01:32:07.661
We must act before they release her.

01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:09.492
You loved her.

01:32:10.732 --> 01:32:12.700
She's the one.

01:32:12.767 --> 01:32:14.758
And then you betrayed her.

01:32:14.836 --> 01:32:18.636
She pretended to love me.

01:32:18.706 --> 01:32:22.472
She betrayed me.

01:32:25.313 --> 01:32:28.840
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.816
Do not test me.

01:32:34.889 --> 01:32:36.618
I hadn't finished that.

01:32:38.626 --> 01:32:40.753
You will free my father.

01:32:41.462 --> 01:32:43.930
And you will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.

01:32:43.998 --> 01:32:45.590
Along with my own.

01:32:45.667 --> 01:32:48.227
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.

01:32:48.303 --> 01:32:51.067
We will expect fair value in return.

01:32:51.506 --> 01:32:55.442
There is only one price I will accept:

01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:58.570
Calypso murdered.

01:33:00.481 --> 01:33:02.813
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.

01:33:04.886 --> 01:33:08.253
Jack has sailed
the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.

01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:14.523
And with you no longer aboard her,
how do you propose to lead us there?

01:33:26.374 --> 01:33:28.934
What is it you want most?

01:34:00.875 --> 01:34:02.433
Look at them all.

01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:06.606
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

01:34:07.415 --> 01:34:09.406
And I owe them all money.

01:34:14.822 --> 01:34:17.290
As he who issued summons,

01:34:17.358 --> 01:34:21.920
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.458
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:34.303
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.

01:34:42.450 --> 01:34:45.647
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.451
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.

01:34:49.524 --> 01:34:53.858
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.

01:34:54.562 --> 01:34:55.620
So change the name.

01:34:56.831 --> 01:35:01.029
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"

01:35:01.102 --> 01:35:03.434
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.

01:35:07.075 --> 01:35:09.566
Master Ragetti, if you will.

01:35:10.378 --> 01:35:13.370
I kept it safe, just like
you said when you gave it to me.

01:35:13.448 --> 01:35:16.542
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.

01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:20.512
Sparrow.

01:35:26.627 --> 01:35:30.256
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,

01:35:30.331 --> 01:35:34.290
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

01:35:34.368 --> 01:35:35.960
Sao Feng is dead.

01:35:38.106 --> 01:35:40.199
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.

01:35:40.441 --> 01:35:41.567
The plagued ship.

01:35:42.810 --> 01:35:46.211
He made you captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.249
- ¡Que lo manden al diablo!
- Listen. Listen to me.

01:35:49.317 --> 01:35:51.547
Our location has been betrayed.

01:35:51.619 --> 01:35:55.248
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

01:35:55.323 --> 01:35:59.020
- Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.

01:35:59.393 --> 01:36:01.418
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

01:36:01.496 --> 01:36:04.226
It matters not how they found us.
The question is,

01:36:04.298 --> 01:36:06.789
what will we do now that they have?

01:36:06.868 --> 01:36:08.358
We fight.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.876
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

01:36:15.943 --> 01:36:18.741
A well-supplied fortress.

01:36:19.347 --> 01:36:23.147
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

01:36:23.918 --> 01:36:27.285
There be a third course.

01:36:28.523 --> 01:36:30.957
In another age, at this very spot,

01:36:31.025 --> 01:36:36.520
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.

01:36:39.267 --> 01:36:40.700
That was a mistake.

01:36:41.702 --> 01:36:44.466
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

01:36:45.439 --> 01:36:48.533
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

01:36:50.545 --> 01:36:52.979
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

01:36:53.047 --> 01:36:56.881
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

01:36:56.951 --> 01:37:01.320
but from the sweat of a mars brow
and the strength of his back alone.

01:37:01.389 --> 01:37:03.220
You all know this to be true.

01:37:04.058 --> 01:37:05.423
Gentlemen.

01:37:06.527 --> 01:37:07.687
Ladies.

01:37:12.333 --> 01:37:15.325
We must free Calypso.

01:37:24.345 --> 01:37:26.779
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

01:37:26.847 --> 01:37:30.749
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

01:37:30.818 --> 01:37:33.343
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.

01:37:33.421 --> 01:37:36.322
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.

01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:38.324
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

01:37:38.392 --> 01:37:42.226
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

01:37:42.296 --> 01:37:45.231
- You threaten me?
- I silence you.

01:37:57.478 --> 01:38:00.641
- This is madness.
- This is politics.

01:38:00.715 --> 01:38:03.309
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

01:38:03.384 --> 01:38:05.909
If they not be here already.

01:38:42.123 --> 01:38:44.489
My sweet.

01:38:44.792 --> 01:38:46.919
You come for me.

01:38:47.895 --> 01:38:52.855
- You were expecting me.
- It has been torture.

01:38:52.933 --> 01:38:57.165
Trapped in this single form.

01:38:57.705 --> 01:39:00.071
Cut off from the sea.

01:39:00.541 --> 01:39:03.135
From all that I love.

01:39:04.412 --> 01:39:05.811
From you.

01:39:06.514 --> 01:39:11.042
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged to me.

01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:17.824
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.

01:39:18.492 --> 01:39:23.054
And, finally,
when we could be together again...

01:39:24.832 --> 01:39:28.632
...you weren't there.

01:39:29.036 --> 01:39:31.630
Why weren't you there?

01:39:35.042 --> 01:39:36.669
It's my nature.

01:39:37.878 --> 01:39:42.474
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?

01:39:43.651 --> 01:39:47.451
I do not love you.

01:39:49.957 --> 01:39:53.654
Many things you were, Davy Jones.

01:39:54.729 --> 01:39:56.856
But never cruel.

01:39:57.698 --> 01:40:00.667
You have corrupted your purpose...

01:40:02.036 --> 01:40:04.630
...and so your self.

01:40:05.706 --> 01:40:10.575
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.

01:40:30.464 --> 01:40:33.524
Calypso.

01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:38.435
I will be free.

01:40:40.374 --> 01:40:44.071
And when I am,
I would give you my heart.

01:40:44.845 --> 01:40:47.837
And we would be together always.

01:40:48.482 --> 01:40:51.849
If only you had a heart to give.

01:40:56.624 --> 01:40:58.683
Why did you come?

01:41:15.976 --> 01:41:21.141
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

01:41:21.549 --> 01:41:23.540
The Brethren Court?

01:41:25.519 --> 01:41:30.320
All of them, the last thing
they will learn in this life...

01:41:30.391 --> 01:41:33.087
...is how cruel I can be.

01:41:37.665 --> 01:41:42.125
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

01:41:43.604 --> 01:41:47.096
My heart will always belong to you.

01:42:00.488 --> 01:42:04.288
It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.

01:42:04.358 --> 01:42:06.656
We should be the ones to set her free.

01:42:06.727 --> 01:42:11.061
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.

01:42:11.131 --> 01:42:13.599
Whose boons? Your boons?

01:42:13.667 --> 01:42:16.659
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.

01:42:16.737 --> 01:42:21.140
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.

01:42:22.409 --> 01:42:23.433
Cuttlefish.

01:42:24.645 --> 01:42:26.704
Aye.

01:42:27.681 --> 01:42:30.309
Let us not, dear friends,

01:42:30.384 --> 01:42:33.376
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.

01:42:33.921 --> 01:42:36.116
Flipping glorious little sausages.

01:42:36.190 --> 01:42:40.149
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.

01:42:40.227 --> 01:42:41.489
Human nature, isn't it?

01:42:41.562 --> 01:42:43.587
Or... Or fish nature.

01:42:43.664 --> 01:42:47.395
So, yes, we could hole up here
well-provisioned and well-armed.

01:42:47.468 --> 01:42:49.629
Half of us would be dead
within the month.

01:42:49.703 --> 01:42:53.639
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

01:42:55.509 --> 01:42:56.840
Uh...

01:42:58.579 --> 01:43:04.347
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,

01:43:04.418 --> 01:43:08.411
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.

01:43:09.924 --> 01:43:11.186
I rather doubt it.

01:43:11.992 --> 01:43:15.985
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned

01:43:16.063 --> 01:43:18.930
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:23.365
Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio.

01:43:23.437 --> 01:43:26.201
We are left with but one option.

01:43:26.273 --> 01:43:30.141
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

01:43:32.446 --> 01:43:35.381
...Captain Swann. We must fight.

01:43:35.449 --> 01:43:38.680
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

01:43:38.752 --> 01:43:39.810
- Have so.
- Have not.

01:43:39.954 --> 01:43:41.012
- Have so.
- Have not!

01:43:41.155 --> 01:43:44.318
- You have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

01:43:44.391 --> 01:43:48.691
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

01:43:48.762 --> 01:43:52.960
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:

01:43:53.033 --> 01:43:54.432
We must fight...

01:43:55.202 --> 01:43:56.692
...to run away.

01:43:56.770 --> 01:43:59.102
- Aye!
- Aye!

01:44:00.874 --> 01:44:05.311
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

01:44:05.379 --> 01:44:08.280
can only be declared by the pirate king.

01:44:08.349 --> 01:44:10.909
- You made that up.
- Did I, now?

01:44:10.985 --> 01:44:15.513
I call on Cap'n Teague,
keeper of the code.

01:44:16.523 --> 01:44:19.959
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

01:44:21.595 --> 01:44:24.086
Hang the code. Who cares a...?

01:44:32.106 --> 01:44:33.937
Code is the law.

01:44:45.953 --> 01:44:47.944
You're in my way, boy.

01:44:57.164 --> 01:44:59.792
- The code.
- The code.

01:44:59.867 --> 01:45:02.131
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.

01:45:20.154 --> 01:45:24.113
- That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.

01:45:26.994 --> 01:45:28.484
Sea turtles.

01:45:43.277 --> 01:45:45.973
Ah. Barbossa is right.

01:45:46.046 --> 01:45:47.536
Hang on a minute.

01:45:49.016 --> 01:45:50.984
"It shall be the duties, as the king,

01:45:51.051 --> 01:45:54.509
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries..."

01:45:54.588 --> 01:45:55.577
Fancy that.

01:45:55.656 --> 01:45:58.124
There has not been a king
since the First Court.

01:45:58.192 --> 01:45:59.853
And that's not likely to change.

01:45:59.927 --> 01:46:01.952
- Not likely.
- Why not?

01:46:02.096 --> 01:46:04.724
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.

01:46:04.798 --> 01:46:08.290
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

01:46:08.368 --> 01:46:09.460
I call for a vote.

01:46:14.274 --> 01:46:16.640
I vote for Ammand the corsair.

01:46:16.710 --> 01:46:19.270
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

01:46:19.646 --> 01:46:22.308
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

01:46:23.217 --> 01:46:25.151
Mistress Ching.

01:46:25.219 --> 01:46:26.618
Gentleman Jocard.

01:46:27.321 --> 01:46:29.881
- Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.

01:46:29.957 --> 01:46:31.720
Vallenueva!

01:46:32.559 --> 01:46:33.890
Elizabeth Swann.

01:46:34.928 --> 01:46:36.862
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

01:46:39.399 --> 01:46:41.026
Vote for me. Vote for me.

01:46:43.504 --> 01:46:44.903
What you talking about?

01:46:44.972 --> 01:46:46.064
No!

01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:49.769
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the code, then?

01:46:58.652 --> 01:46:59.846
Very well.

01:47:03.223 --> 01:47:08.217
What say you, Captain Swann,
king of the Brethren Court?

01:47:10.197 --> 01:47:12.529
Prepare every vessel that floats.

01:47:13.367 --> 01:47:14.527
At dawn...

01:47:16.103 --> 01:47:17.297
...we're at war.

01:47:21.108 --> 01:47:24.703
And so we shall go to war.

01:47:38.392 --> 01:47:39.381
What?

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:43.158
You've seen it all,
done it all. You survived.

01:47:43.697 --> 01:47:46.530
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:50.558
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

01:47:54.508 --> 01:47:58.604
The trick is
living with yourself forever.

01:48:02.649 --> 01:48:03.809
How's Mum?

01:48:10.757 --> 01:48:12.281
She looks great.

01:48:33.714 --> 01:48:37.309
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

01:49:00.674 --> 01:49:03.165
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

01:49:12.119 --> 01:49:13.279
Parley?

01:50:10.077 --> 01:50:13.706
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:17.978
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.

01:50:18.051 --> 01:50:22.579
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.

01:50:25.993 --> 01:50:27.688
My hands are clean in this.

01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:29.889
Figuratively.

01:50:30.430 --> 01:50:32.898
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

01:50:32.966 --> 01:50:36.402
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:38.438
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.

01:50:39.373 --> 01:50:42.706
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

01:50:43.543 --> 01:50:47.411
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

01:50:49.649 --> 01:50:54.552
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

01:50:55.756 --> 01:51:00.716
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

01:51:01.495 --> 01:51:04.862
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

01:51:04.931 --> 01:51:08.833
Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

01:51:08.902 --> 01:51:13.862
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman. As a start.

01:51:14.541 --> 01:51:17.772
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

01:51:17.844 --> 01:51:20.244
- You escaped.
- Technically.

01:51:20.313 --> 01:51:22.372
I propose an exchange.

01:51:24.451 --> 01:51:26.316
Will leaves with us...

01:51:27.054 --> 01:51:28.817
...and you can take Jack.

01:51:30.924 --> 01:51:31.913
Done.

01:51:32.592 --> 01:51:34.287
- Undone.
- Done.

01:51:34.361 --> 01:51:37.888
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

01:51:37.964 --> 01:51:39.431
King.

01:51:41.935 --> 01:51:45.996
- As you command, your nibs.
- Blackguard!

01:51:51.211 --> 01:51:54.908
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

01:51:57.584 --> 01:51:59.609
First to the finish, then?

01:52:20.907 --> 01:52:23.467
Do you fear death?

01:52:25.011 --> 01:52:26.774
You've no idea.

01:52:29.716 --> 01:52:31.581
Advise your Brethren,

01:52:31.651 --> 01:52:34.745
you can fight, and all of you will die.

01:52:34.821 --> 01:52:39.349
Or you can not fight,
in which case only most of you will die.

01:52:39.926 --> 01:52:42.019
You murdered my father.

01:52:43.396 --> 01:52:45.387
He chose his own fate.

01:52:46.032 --> 01:52:48.762
And you have chosen yours.

01:52:48.835 --> 01:52:50.894
We will fight.

01:52:51.505 --> 01:52:53.302
And you will die.

01:52:58.111 --> 01:52:59.738
So be it.

01:53:05.752 --> 01:53:07.117
King?

01:53:07.187 --> 01:53:10.020
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.

01:53:10.524 --> 01:53:12.856
Maybe he really
does know what he's doing.

01:53:19.299 --> 01:53:20.288
Bravo!

01:53:21.334 --> 01:53:25.532
You've successfully arrived aboard
the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.

01:53:25.605 --> 01:53:27.334
- Look
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

01:53:27.407 --> 01:53:30.467
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

01:53:31.745 --> 01:53:32.905
Go away.

01:53:32.979 --> 01:53:36.142
- What, back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

01:53:36.983 --> 01:53:38.075
Stab the heart.

01:53:43.957 --> 01:53:49.088
Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.

01:53:52.899 --> 01:53:54.491
Then again...

01:53:55.335 --> 01:53:57.030
...if you're in the brig...

01:53:58.538 --> 01:54:00.529
...who's to stab the heart?

01:54:03.043 --> 01:54:05.910
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

01:54:07.647 --> 01:54:09.380
Peanut.

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:12.645
We'll need to use the Black Pearl
as a flagship to lead the attack.

01:54:12.716 --> 01:54:16.880
- Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.

01:54:17.488 --> 01:54:20.924
Barbossa, you can't release her.

01:54:20.991 --> 01:54:22.891
We need to give Jack a chance.

01:54:23.494 --> 01:54:28.431
Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.

01:54:31.301 --> 01:54:32.598
No longer.

01:54:34.605 --> 01:54:36.300
The enemy...

01:54:37.474 --> 01:54:39.806
...has opted for oblivion.

01:54:42.946 --> 01:54:44.573
Ready the fleet.

01:54:44.815 --> 01:54:47.545
- To your stations.
- To your stations.

01:54:54.024 --> 01:54:57.187
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?

01:54:57.261 --> 01:54:58.523
Aye.

01:54:58.962 --> 01:55:02.227
The items brought together, done.

01:55:02.299 --> 01:55:04.699
Items to be burned...

01:55:05.369 --> 01:55:07.530
...and someone must speak the words:

01:55:07.604 --> 01:55:11.096
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds."

01:55:11.175 --> 01:55:12.164
Is that it?

01:55:12.743 --> 01:55:16.804
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:18.575
Ooh!

01:55:22.653 --> 01:55:27.955
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!

01:55:37.534 --> 01:55:41.595
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. He didn't say it right.

01:55:46.543 --> 01:55:47.567
He didn't...

01:55:48.045 --> 01:55:49.910
You have to say it right.

01:55:58.522 --> 01:55:59.511
Calypso...

01:56:04.895 --> 01:56:07.329
...I release you from your human bonds.

01:56:25.916 --> 01:56:27.611
Tia Dalma.

01:56:30.053 --> 01:56:31.384
Calypso.

01:56:33.857 --> 01:56:38.021
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?

01:56:40.464 --> 01:56:44.366
- Who was it that betrayed you?
- Name him.

01:56:45.636 --> 01:56:47.399
Davy Jones.

01:57:01.418 --> 01:57:05.252
This is it! This is it!

01:57:47.864 --> 01:57:49.627
Calypso!

01:57:51.835 --> 01:57:56.966
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.

01:57:58.875 --> 01:58:03.744
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favor.

01:58:06.783 --> 01:58:09.775
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...

01:58:10.187 --> 01:58:14.647
...but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...

01:58:15.158 --> 01:58:16.318
...or mine.

01:59:14.251 --> 01:59:15.513
Is that it?

01:59:18.255 --> 01:59:20.246
Why, she's no help at all.

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:25.257
What now?

01:59:26.163 --> 01:59:27.425
Nothing.

01:59:28.231 --> 01:59:31.166
Our final hope has failed us.

01:59:58.628 --> 02:00:01.620
- It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.

02:00:01.698 --> 02:00:05.634
We've an armada against us, and
with the Dutchman, there's no chance.

02:00:05.702 --> 02:00:08.000
There's only a fool's chance.

02:00:08.071 --> 02:00:10.835
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

02:00:10.907 --> 02:00:14.172
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

02:00:19.149 --> 02:00:20.639
You're right.

02:00:26.022 --> 02:00:27.990
Then what shall we die for?

02:00:31.695 --> 02:00:33.094
You will listen to me.

02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:35.092
Listen!

02:00:38.034 --> 02:00:43.097
The Brethren will still be looking here
to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.

02:00:43.673 --> 02:00:45.106
And what will they see?

02:00:45.609 --> 02:00:48.942
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

02:00:49.012 --> 02:00:53.244
No, they will see free men and freedom!

02:00:53.316 --> 02:00:56.752
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

02:00:56.820 --> 02:01:02.053
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

02:01:04.761 --> 02:01:07.059
By the sweat of our brows,

02:01:07.130 --> 02:01:09.462
and the strength of our backs...

02:01:09.866 --> 02:01:12.858
...and the courage of our hearts.

02:01:15.572 --> 02:01:17.062
Gentlemen...

02:01:19.776 --> 02:01:21.243
...hoist the colors.

02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:24.713
Hoist the colors.

02:01:24.781 --> 02:01:27.079
- Hoist the colors.
- Hoist the colors!

02:01:27.150 --> 02:01:29.209
Aye.

02:01:29.286 --> 02:01:32.949
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!

02:01:34.925 --> 02:01:37.018
Hoist the colors!

02:02:28.078 --> 02:02:30.273
We have a favorable wind, sir.

02:02:31.014 --> 02:02:32.208
Oh, so we do.

02:02:32.849 --> 02:02:35.818
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

02:02:36.853 --> 02:02:38.912
That should brighten his day.

02:02:42.859 --> 02:02:46.795
To arms! We give no quarter!

02:02:56.039 --> 02:02:57.836
Calypso.

02:03:24.467 --> 02:03:27.402
Have you noticed,
on top of everything, it's raining?

02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:28.528
That's a bad sign.

02:03:28.605 --> 02:03:33.542
Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.

02:03:48.158 --> 02:03:49.989
Maelstrom!

02:03:53.196 --> 02:03:55.221
Captain Barbossa!

02:03:56.166 --> 02:03:58.191
We need you at the helm.

02:04:00.704 --> 02:04:03.070
Aye, that be true.

02:04:05.375 --> 02:04:10.335
Brace up yards,
you cack-handed deck apes.

02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:14.482
Dying is the day worth living for.

02:04:24.794 --> 02:04:26.421
Veer off!

02:04:26.496 --> 02:04:28.760
She'll not harm us.

02:04:29.265 --> 02:04:31.597
Full-bore and into the abyss.

02:04:32.302 --> 02:04:33.633
Are you mad?

02:04:33.703 --> 02:04:36.672
Ha! You afraid to get wet?

02:04:46.216 --> 02:04:48.582
She's on our stern and gaining.

02:04:48.651 --> 02:04:54.214
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.

02:05:01.197 --> 02:05:03.597
Bow cannons!

02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:06.568
Blow the cannons!

02:05:17.447 --> 02:05:20.348
Take us out or they'll overbear us.

02:05:20.417 --> 02:05:25.320
Nay. Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.

02:05:26.523 --> 02:05:28.616
Prepare to broadside.

02:05:39.069 --> 02:05:41.333
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.

02:05:41.404 --> 02:05:45.238
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.

02:05:52.415 --> 02:05:56.010
Think like the whelp. Think like
the whelp. Think like the whelp.

02:05:56.086 --> 02:05:58.281
Hinges. Hinges.

02:05:58.354 --> 02:05:59.651
Think like the whelp.

02:05:59.722 --> 02:06:01.155
Half-barrel hinges.

02:06:01.257 --> 02:06:02.554
Leverage.

02:06:07.530 --> 02:06:09.760
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

02:06:11.234 --> 02:06:14.067
- I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

02:06:14.137 --> 02:06:15.695
Nobody move.

02:06:16.773 --> 02:06:18.536
I dropped me brain.

02:06:28.418 --> 02:06:31.182
Batten down the hatches!

02:06:32.489 --> 02:06:34.514
Stand to your guns.

02:06:35.091 --> 02:06:37.582
Midship canoneers, sight the masts.

02:06:41.831 --> 02:06:44.265
Main battery at the ready!

02:06:48.838 --> 02:06:53.104
Hold there!
Wait till we're board-and-board.

02:06:57.680 --> 02:06:59.409
Fire!

02:06:59.782 --> 02:07:04.116
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire all!

02:07:05.054 --> 02:07:06.214
Fire!

02:07:10.093 --> 02:07:11.651
Fire!

02:07:21.237 --> 02:07:22.704
Come on, men.

02:07:32.715 --> 02:07:37.345
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

02:07:41.724 --> 02:07:43.954
Halt there or we'll shoot.

02:07:45.461 --> 02:07:46.587
Good one.

02:07:49.065 --> 02:07:51.090
I just come to get me effects.

02:07:52.702 --> 02:07:56.900
Admirable though it may be, why are
you here when you could be elsewhere?

02:07:56.973 --> 02:07:59.237
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

02:08:00.710 --> 02:08:05.272
There's no question, there's a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.

02:08:05.348 --> 02:08:07.009
I blame the fish people.

02:08:07.083 --> 02:08:11.452
Oh, so fish people,
by dint of being fish people,

02:08:11.521 --> 02:08:14.752
automatically aren't
as disciplined as non-fish people?

02:08:14.824 --> 02:08:17.190
Seems contributory,
is all I'm suggesting.

02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:22.163
It's true, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

02:08:22.232 --> 02:08:25.668
And if there were no chest
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.

02:08:33.209 --> 02:08:35.234
Prepare to board!

02:08:36.879 --> 02:08:38.073
Cover!

02:08:54.731 --> 02:08:56.460
No!

02:09:22.392 --> 02:09:27.352
Lookee here, boys. A lost bird.

02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:31.332
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

02:09:32.635 --> 02:09:34.398
To my great regret.

02:09:35.705 --> 02:09:36.831
But...

02:09:39.575 --> 02:09:41.566
...never too late to learn, eh?

02:09:49.752 --> 02:09:51.219
Whoa!

02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:01.193
The chest, hand it over.

02:10:01.264 --> 02:10:03.095
I can set you free, mate.

02:10:03.166 --> 02:10:06.192
My freedom was forfeited long ago.

02:10:53.249 --> 02:10:54.580
Elizabeth.

02:10:58.354 --> 02:10:59.582
Elizabeth.

02:11:00.623 --> 02:11:01.988
Will you marry me?

02:11:03.793 --> 02:11:05.624
I don't think now's the best time.

02:11:09.432 --> 02:11:11.491
Now may be the only time.

02:11:16.706 --> 02:11:17.900
I love you.

02:11:23.846 --> 02:11:26.371
I've made my choice. What's yours?

02:11:27.216 --> 02:11:28.513
Barbossa.

02:11:29.986 --> 02:11:31.419
Marry us.

02:11:32.522 --> 02:11:35.184
I'm a little busy at the moment.

02:11:41.397 --> 02:11:43.388
Barbossa, now.

02:11:45.067 --> 02:11:46.398
Fine, then.

02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:00.408
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today...

02:12:01.117 --> 02:12:04.644
To nail your gizzards
to the mast, you poxy cur.

02:12:09.525 --> 02:12:12.551
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?

02:12:12.628 --> 02:12:14.596
- I do.
- Great.

02:12:21.070 --> 02:12:23.334
Will Turner, do you take me...

02:12:24.607 --> 02:12:26.336
...to be your wife...

02:12:30.746 --> 02:12:32.714
...in sickness and in health...

02:12:33.616 --> 02:12:35.846
...with health being the less likely?

02:12:43.059 --> 02:12:44.287
I do.

02:12:46.562 --> 02:12:49.463
As captain, I now pronounce you...

02:12:52.435 --> 02:12:54.266
You may kiss...

02:13:03.145 --> 02:13:04.578
You may kiss...

02:13:09.552 --> 02:13:11.213
Just kiss.

02:13:49.926 --> 02:13:51.587
Leave it.

02:14:03.839 --> 02:14:06.501
You can do nothing without the key.

02:14:06.576 --> 02:14:08.043
I already have the key.

02:14:09.312 --> 02:14:10.745
No, you don't.

02:14:12.248 --> 02:14:13.545
Oh, that key.

02:14:49.619 --> 02:14:50.608
No!

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:20.171
Oi. My pistol.

02:15:47.877 --> 02:15:49.276
Turner.

02:15:54.283 --> 02:15:55.272
Fire!

02:16:01.223 --> 02:16:02.781
Thank you, Jack.

02:16:32.621 --> 02:16:34.145
Stop! It's me.

02:16:36.659 --> 02:16:39.560
It's Will. Your son.

02:17:08.357 --> 02:17:09.722
Ha!

02:17:40.689 --> 02:17:42.156
Go!

02:18:00.576 --> 02:18:04.637
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

02:18:04.713 --> 02:18:07.045
That's why I brought this.

02:18:26.468 --> 02:18:29.699
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

02:18:38.314 --> 02:18:39.645
Missed.

02:18:40.850 --> 02:18:45.719
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.

02:19:02.271 --> 02:19:05.570
Ah. Love.

02:19:05.941 --> 02:19:09.433
A dreadful bond.

02:19:10.212 --> 02:19:15.206
And yet, so easily severed.

02:19:15.284 --> 02:19:20.483
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?

02:19:20.556 --> 02:19:21.989
Do you?

02:19:32.735 --> 02:19:36.432
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.

02:19:37.039 --> 02:19:41.442
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

02:19:42.311 --> 02:19:44.745
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

02:19:45.314 --> 02:19:46.872
Is it?

02:20:12.641 --> 02:20:13.767
Will?

02:20:15.377 --> 02:20:17.971
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.

02:20:23.852 --> 02:20:25.513
William?

02:20:25.955 --> 02:20:27.650
My son.

02:20:39.535 --> 02:20:43.027
Will? Will?
Look at me. Look at me!

02:20:46.742 --> 02:20:50.644
You will not forestall my judgment.

02:21:06.428 --> 02:21:08.089
Calypso.

02:21:13.936 --> 02:21:19.397
She's taking us down! Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all!

02:21:50.372 --> 02:21:51.430
No.

02:21:55.544 --> 02:21:57.034
No, no.

02:21:57.112 --> 02:21:58.841
No!

02:22:00.115 --> 02:22:04.415
Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

02:22:04.486 --> 02:22:07.978
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

02:22:08.057 --> 02:22:10.082
Don't leave me.

02:22:11.393 --> 02:22:13.088
Don't. No!

02:22:13.162 --> 02:22:15.027
I won't leave you.

02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:27.335
The Dutchman must have a captain.

02:22:30.679 --> 02:22:32.670
Hold on.

02:23:26.401 --> 02:23:28.062
Thank goodness, Jack.

02:23:28.137 --> 02:23:32.096
The armada's still out there. The
Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard,

02:23:32.174 --> 02:23:36.270
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

02:23:36.345 --> 02:23:38.973
Never actually been one for tradition.

02:23:43.952 --> 02:23:46.978
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.

02:23:47.055 --> 02:23:49.319
Belay that,
or we'll be a sitting duck.

02:23:49.391 --> 02:23:50.722
Belay that "belay that."

02:23:50.792 --> 02:23:52.555
- But the arma...
- Belay.

02:23:52.661 --> 02:23:54.925
- The Endeav...
- Stow. Shut it.

02:24:08.010 --> 02:24:10.035
What are they waiting for?

02:24:11.013 --> 02:24:13.982
He expects us to honor our agreement.

02:24:16.151 --> 02:24:18.984
Ready guns and gun ports.

02:24:22.724 --> 02:24:27.627
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

02:24:54.489 --> 02:24:56.980
Ah, she survived.

02:25:22.117 --> 02:25:25.484
- Ready on the guns.
- Guns ready.

02:25:26.121 --> 02:25:28.282
Full canvas.

02:25:28.357 --> 02:25:30.723
Aye, full canvas.

02:25:55.250 --> 02:25:56.547
Orders, sir.

02:26:00.022 --> 02:26:01.148
Sir!

02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:02.779
Cap'n.

02:26:03.225 --> 02:26:05.853
- Fire.
- Fire!

02:26:05.927 --> 02:26:07.986
- Fire!
- Fire!

02:26:08.063 --> 02:26:10.031
Fire, all!

02:26:20.609 --> 02:26:23.510
Orders? Orders, sir?

02:26:35.891 --> 02:26:37.358
Sir, what do you command?

02:26:37.993 --> 02:26:39.324
It's just...

02:26:41.430 --> 02:26:43.125
...good business.

02:26:44.833 --> 02:26:46.164
Abandon ship!

02:26:46.234 --> 02:26:50.261
- Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!

02:28:16.024 --> 02:28:17.753
They're turning away!

02:28:30.105 --> 02:28:31.970
Wind in your sails.

02:28:37.212 --> 02:28:39.271
Shiver me timbers.

02:29:00.268 --> 02:29:02.327
Captain Turner!

02:29:16.985 --> 02:29:19.078
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Cap'n?

02:29:20.288 --> 02:29:23.280
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.

02:29:23.358 --> 02:29:25.053
Hooray!

02:29:27.295 --> 02:29:29.058
Now go and get it.

02:29:47.482 --> 02:29:49.074
Orders, sir?

02:29:53.355 --> 02:29:57.382
You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman. You're free.

02:29:57.459 --> 02:29:59.450
Aye.

02:29:59.528 --> 02:30:01.928
That's a fine thing, but...

02:30:03.532 --> 02:30:08.231
...by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.

02:30:08.303 --> 02:30:09.895
If you'll have me.

02:30:13.942 --> 02:30:15.807
On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.

02:30:17.178 --> 02:30:19.169
Aye, Captain Turner.

02:30:34.129 --> 02:30:36.791
This ship
has a purpose again.

02:30:36.865 --> 02:30:38.890
And where we are bound...

02:30:39.568 --> 02:30:42.036
...she cannot come.

02:30:42.103 --> 02:30:44.071
One day ashore.

02:30:44.139 --> 02:30:46.232
Ten years at sea.

02:30:47.208 --> 02:30:50.041
That's a steep price
for what's been done.

02:30:52.213 --> 02:30:54.204
Depends on the one day.

02:30:56.985 --> 02:30:59.545
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

02:31:03.358 --> 02:31:05.349
The oars are inside.

02:31:16.972 --> 02:31:18.940
Mrs. Turner.

02:31:23.845 --> 02:31:25.403
Goodbye, poppet.

02:31:31.219 --> 02:31:32.516
Jack.

02:31:33.755 --> 02:31:36.280
It would never
have worked out between us.

02:31:39.628 --> 02:31:42.096
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

02:31:45.533 --> 02:31:47.398
Once was quite enough.

02:31:49.804 --> 02:31:51.795
Thank you.

02:32:11.126 --> 02:32:13.117
I'm going to need the other one.

02:32:45.126 --> 02:32:47.117
It's nearly sunset.

02:33:06.281 --> 02:33:07.976
It's always belonged to you.

02:33:13.755 --> 02:33:15.313
Will you keep it safe?

02:33:17.125 --> 02:33:18.285
Yes.

02:33:22.297 --> 02:33:23.389
Yes.

02:33:43.318 --> 02:33:44.307
Will!

02:33:59.901 --> 02:34:02.062
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

02:34:30.932 --> 02:34:34.231
Granted it tends to list to port,
and has been, on occasion,

02:34:34.302 --> 02:34:36.532
known to frighten young women.

02:34:36.604 --> 02:34:40.973
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

02:34:41.676 --> 02:34:42.802
Is that it?

02:34:43.411 --> 02:34:44.935
The Black Pearl.

02:34:45.580 --> 02:34:47.673
It's not very big.

02:34:47.749 --> 02:34:50.149
Love, that is a dinghy.

02:34:50.218 --> 02:34:55.588
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and huge-ish and...

02:34:56.057 --> 02:34:59.185
...gone. Why is it gone?

02:35:00.128 --> 02:35:01.720
Is that it there?

02:35:02.931 --> 02:35:04.057
Yes, there it is.

02:35:05.066 --> 02:35:06.294
Why is it there?

02:35:07.669 --> 02:35:09.227
It's much larger up close.

02:35:09.304 --> 02:35:11.670
Jack, you promised
to take us for a ride.

02:35:11.739 --> 02:35:15.675
- I was to be given the first ride.
- What? You?

02:35:15.743 --> 02:35:18.337
- Not what he said.
- I never!

02:35:20.148 --> 02:35:24.278
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

02:35:24.352 --> 02:35:27.185
The ship? We're on the ship.

02:35:29.824 --> 02:35:32.691
Jack! The ship's gone!

02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:33.818
Really?

02:35:35.864 --> 02:35:39.129
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:42.567
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.

02:35:42.637 --> 02:35:44.127
No, I don't love you.

02:35:44.205 --> 02:35:47.299
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

02:35:47.375 --> 02:35:50.105
It is pronounced "egregious."

02:35:50.178 --> 02:35:54.205
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

02:35:54.282 --> 02:35:56.978
And all of this pales
to utter insignificance

02:35:57.051 --> 02:36:00.782
in light of the fact that
my ship is once again gone. Savvy?

02:36:13.334 --> 02:36:16.269
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

02:36:20.174 --> 02:36:24.201
Tell me, ladies,
what do you know of sea turtles?

02:36:24.279 --> 02:36:25.371
Sea turtles?

02:36:25.647 --> 02:36:27.877
Let me tell you
the amazing story of Cap...

02:36:27.949 --> 02:36:30.611
All men up the ratlines.

02:36:31.019 --> 02:36:33.817
All men up the ratlines!

02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:41.190
Oh, you want a taste of this?

02:36:42.697 --> 02:36:45.894
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.

02:36:45.967 --> 02:36:48.595
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, yes, you are.

02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:49.659
Sir?

02:36:51.039 --> 02:36:53.564
Some of the men don't feel
entirely settled

02:36:53.641 --> 02:36:56.132
- about leaving Captain Jack behind.
- Again.

02:36:56.277 --> 02:36:59.178
- Again.
- Is that so?

02:36:59.447 --> 02:37:03.110
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes

02:37:03.184 --> 02:37:05.880
if we could see that item
you told us about.

02:37:05.954 --> 02:37:08.115
- On the charts.
- Aye.

02:37:08.222 --> 02:37:09.621
With our own eyes.

02:37:09.691 --> 02:37:13.286
To help put an ease
to our burden of guilt, so to speak.

02:37:13.728 --> 02:37:15.559
Ah.

02:37:15.630 --> 02:37:17.860
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

02:37:18.266 --> 02:37:20.791
There's more than one way
to live forever.

02:37:20.868 --> 02:37:24.599
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.

02:37:35.383 --> 02:37:37.248

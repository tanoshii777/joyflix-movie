00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.042
What the fuck, Caleb?

00:01:09.178 --> 00:01:10.806
Oh, wait till you see
the shot I got.

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:13.112
You looked like you were gonna
shit a brick out sideways.

00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:14.940
You could have taken
my head off.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.441
It wouldn't have been a clean
decapitation

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:17.976
with these blades.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.013
You'd just scramble
your face up real good.

00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:31.163
Shouldn't you go see if
Jessica is feeling any better?

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.093
She'll be fine.
I gave her Klonopin

00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:36.234
so she can sleep off whatever
the fuck is wrong with her.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.231
Girl is such a pain
in the ass.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.298
Jessica?

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:24.510
Hey.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:25.978
How you feeling, cuz?

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.583
Since none of these other
friends of yours

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.660
bothered to show up,

00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:37.898
can I take your car and escape
the hell of being stuck here

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.997
with your latest boyfriend?

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:45.899
Great chat.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.677
You better wake up
in the next half hour

00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:59.351
or I'm gonna be forced
to go drown

00:02:59.487 --> 00:03:01.915
that brainless meat puppet's
sorry ass.

00:03:31.248 --> 00:03:34.288
"The intense horror
of my nightmare came over me."

00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:37.121
"I tried to draw back my arm

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:39.358
but the hand clung on

00:03:39.493 --> 00:03:42.586
and a most melancholy
voice sobbed,

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:43.961
'Let me in.'"

00:03:44.097 --> 00:03:45.299
"'Let me in!'"

00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:48.528
"As it spoke,

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:50.700
I discerned, obscurely

00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:53.164
a child's face
looking through the window."

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:56.800
"Finding it useless to attempt

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.642
shaking the creature off,

00:03:58.777 --> 00:04:01.274
I pulled its wrist on to
the broken pane..."

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.978
Jess?

00:04:03.113 --> 00:04:05.252
-"...and rubbed it
to and fro..."
-Please shut up.

00:04:05.387 --> 00:04:06.712
"...till the blood ran down

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.751
and soaked the bedclothes."

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:11.957
"Yet still it wailed,
'Let me in!'"

00:04:12.092 --> 00:04:13.426
Jessica!

00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:38.918
Shit, shit, shit!

00:04:39.053 --> 00:04:40.349
Shit, shit, shit!

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.690
No, Jess. Jess? Jess?

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:07.913
Who's the brainless
meat puppet now?

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:21.454
Caleb.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.827
What the fuck?

00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:25.998
Oh, my God.

00:05:26.134 --> 00:05:27.324
What the hell happened?

00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:31.933
Jess?

00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:36.404
Jessica?

00:05:48.618 --> 00:05:50.253
What the fuck? What?

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.151
No, no, no...

00:05:53.027 --> 00:05:54.351
Caleb!

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:57.394
No...

00:06:00.936 --> 00:06:02.231
No, Caleb!

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.300
Caleb!

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.295
Beth!

00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:13.500
Beth, you in there?

00:07:15.542 --> 00:07:17.804
Just give me five, all right?

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:19.476
Brandon is losing his shit.

00:07:19.612 --> 00:07:20.976
He can't find the Strat he won

00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:23.616
in that arm wrestling contest
last night.

00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:25.585
It's already tuned and racked
stage left

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.148
like I told you it was
half an hour ago.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:31.283
You feeling all right
in there?

00:07:32.258 --> 00:07:33.951
I'm fine.

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:36.220
Just go man your station.

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:38.526
I'll be back before
curtains up.

00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:39.861
You got it, boss.

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:49.560
Have you seen my favorite
black t-shirt?

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.532
I need it for the Labor Day
protest tomorrow.

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.434
Mom?

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.102
You're not going to any
protest on your own.

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:00.778
Sophie's dad's taking us.

00:09:00.914 --> 00:09:02.114
I've told you, like,
ten times already.

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:03.849
Remember?

00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:05.245
Well, did you remember
to check the bathroom hamper?

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.051
Tell Danny
to turn the music down.

00:09:11.187 --> 00:09:12.888
Mom says,
"Turn the music down!"

00:09:13.024 --> 00:09:14.590
I could've done that myself!

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.441
Kassie, you better not have
my scissors.

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:39.983
Don't got 'em, Mom!

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.518
It's dirty.

00:09:45.653 --> 00:09:46.955
Well, stick it in the laundry,
and I'll do it later.

00:09:47.091 --> 00:09:48.924
You'll forget.
You always forget.

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:51.461
You know where
the washing machine is.

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:00.169
Hey, Bridget.
Mom's on nights

00:10:00.304 --> 00:10:02.172
and we're watching
all the Freddy movies in a row.

00:10:02.307 --> 00:10:05.140
-Even the shitty ones.
-There aren't any shitty ones.

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:08.642
So, you, um,
wanna come over and...

00:10:08.777 --> 00:10:10.178
In your dreams.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.429
Your boyfriends are weirdos.

00:10:25.564 --> 00:10:26.762
You're the weirdo.

00:10:29.094 --> 00:10:31.434
Kassie!

00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:48.749
Big crowd in tonight, Dan?

00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:52.887
-Get out, Bridge!
-I would, but--

00:10:53.023 --> 00:10:54.651
Let me in!

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:08.071
Somebody get that, please!

00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:12.509
All right, all right!

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.159
Boo!

00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:34.060
Beth.

00:11:34.196 --> 00:11:36.194
-You bitch.

00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:37.595
-Surprise, sis.

00:11:39.904 --> 00:11:41.300
When did you get into town?

00:11:41.436 --> 00:11:44.470
I Uber'd straight here
from LAX.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.144
Hmm.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:52.144
You been sleeping?
You look like Mom.

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:54.317
Beats looking like a tampon.

00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:58.121
You know, the downstairs
buzzer is totally busted.

00:11:58.257 --> 00:12:00.117
I was able to walk in
right off the street.

00:12:00.253 --> 00:12:01.551
Whole building's busted.

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:03.494
It's getting knocked
in a month.

00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:04.956
You're kidding me.

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.589
Nope. We're out.

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:08.659
Have you guys found
a new place?

00:12:09.535 --> 00:12:11.563
Not yet.

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:14.731
Shit, El. You and Jay
have been here forever.

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:17.569
Was Bangkok awesome?

00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:20.611
Insane. Crazy, obsessive fans
over there.

00:12:20.747 --> 00:12:21.945
Did you drink snake blood?

00:12:22.081 --> 00:12:23.980
Hey,
that's culturally insensitive.

00:12:24.116 --> 00:12:25.642
What about
monkey brain barbecue?

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.716
Oh, yeah.
That's so much better, Dan.

00:12:27.852 --> 00:12:28.948
Who's your friend, Kass?

00:12:29.084 --> 00:12:30.554
She's called Staffanie.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.426
Oh. Hey, Staffanie.

00:12:33.562 --> 00:12:35.490
What's her, uh, situation?

00:12:35.626 --> 00:12:39.295
Danny told me that when this
building used to be a bank,

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.693
a teller got caught stealing
and hunged himself

00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:43.536
and if you walk around
with coins in your pockets,

00:12:43.671 --> 00:12:45.830
his ghost hears the jingle.

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:48.534
And he scares you to death
so he can take all your money.

00:12:49.905 --> 00:12:51.378
It's true.

00:12:51.513 --> 00:12:53.108
If he comes after me,

00:12:53.244 --> 00:12:55.541
Staffanie will scare him
to death first.

00:12:56.683 --> 00:12:58.179
Ghosts aren't real.

00:12:58.314 --> 00:13:00.050
-Have you ever seen one?
-Mmm-mmm.

00:13:00.186 --> 00:13:02.145
Then how do you know
they don't exist?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.051
Because...

00:13:04.187 --> 00:13:07.324
I only believe what I can see.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.953
For me?

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:13.128
-It's for badass
rock chicks only.

00:13:13.263 --> 00:13:16.861
Look, Mom. I'm a badass.

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:19.702
Please don't indoctrinate her
into your groupie world.

00:13:19.837 --> 00:13:21.005
What's a groupie?

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.667
Your mom's favorite
nickname for me,

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.311
even though she knows
I'm a guitar technician.

00:13:25.447 --> 00:13:26.669
If you say so.

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:29.272
Hey, be nice
or you don't get a gift.

00:13:29.407 --> 00:13:31.375
Speaking of which,

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.645
check out what I got your dad.

00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:44.755
What's going on, El?

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.397
Danny, go take my car and get
pizza with your sisters.

00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:51.663
Sure thing, Mom.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.502
I just can't wrap my head
around all this.

00:13:57.638 --> 00:13:59.439
What, did he meet
someone else?

00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:01.878
No. He believes paying
child support

00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:03.743
equals co-parenting from afar.

00:14:07.854 --> 00:14:09.712
Why didn't you tell me, El?

00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:11.624
I would've jumped
right on a plane

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.421
to help you work through this.

00:14:16.058 --> 00:14:17.326
I called you.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.263
Twice.

00:14:20.398 --> 00:14:22.097
First time, when he told me
he was leaving.

00:14:22.232 --> 00:14:23.728
Second,
the night he moved out.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.908
That was two and half
months ago, Beth.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.084
I'm sorry, okay?

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.217
You know when I'm on the road,
I get sucked in deep

00:14:40.353 --> 00:14:41.788
and I'm trying to make
chief tech right now.

00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:43.248
And if I do,
I'll be the first woman

00:14:43.384 --> 00:14:44.848
in my crew to do it, so...

00:14:47.361 --> 00:14:50.623
Please, Ellie, we need
to talk this through properly.

00:14:52.466 --> 00:14:53.791
El...

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:56.063
Look, you can sleep
on the sofa tonight

00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:58.831
but I gotta pack and move.

00:15:29.203 --> 00:15:30.493
Hey, Bethy-boo.

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:32.236
It's Ellie. Just...

00:15:33.908 --> 00:15:35.734
calling to say hi. And, um...

00:15:36.976 --> 00:15:38.506
me and Jay, we, uh...

00:15:40.643 --> 00:15:42.746
-You know what--

00:15:42.881 --> 00:15:44.784
I don't blame you.

00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:46.582
I hate the sound
of my voice too.

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:00.396
What's going on with you,
Beth?

00:16:04.832 --> 00:16:06.897
I screwed up again,
like I always do.

00:16:08.472 --> 00:16:11.407
And I need you to help me
figure it out.

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:13.211
Again.

00:16:14.209 --> 00:16:15.180
What happened?

00:16:17.012 --> 00:16:18.150
Mmm.

00:16:27.158 --> 00:16:28.551
Hurry up, Bridge.

00:16:28.686 --> 00:16:30.125
You wanna carry them?

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.163
You wanna get your license?

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.892
Come on, Kass.

00:16:47.115 --> 00:16:48.708
Earthquake!

00:16:57.382 --> 00:16:58.223
Come on.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.260
Go!

00:17:07.197 --> 00:17:08.398
Stay down!

00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:24.408
Shit.

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.278
That was intense.

00:17:26.414 --> 00:17:28.121
I think I peed my pants.

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:30.682
Is it warm?

00:17:32.527 --> 00:17:33.791
Mmm-mmm.

00:17:33.927 --> 00:17:35.194
It's probably just soda.

00:17:36.391 --> 00:17:37.559
All right. Come on.

00:17:54.414 --> 00:17:56.413
Holy shit.
Bridget, check this out.

00:17:57.278 --> 00:17:58.349
What is it?

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.582
There's a hole.

00:18:10.661 --> 00:18:12.660
Careful, Dan.
There could be aftershocks.

00:18:24.076 --> 00:18:25.409
It's an old bank vault!

00:18:28.311 --> 00:18:29.809
Danny, don't!

00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:01.247
Dan?

00:19:09.716 --> 00:19:10.922
Come on, Danny. Let's go!

00:19:11.057 --> 00:19:12.324
Just hang on!

00:19:49.829 --> 00:19:51.390
Danny!

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:52.925
Relax a minute, Bridge!

00:20:12.747 --> 00:20:14.445
Danny, are you okay?

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.645
I'm fine.

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:25.983
Anything?

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.450
The network
is totally screwed.

00:21:28.591 --> 00:21:30.154
I'm sure they're fine, El.

00:21:34.235 --> 00:21:36.334
Hey.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.800
Is everyone okay?
Anybody hurt?

00:21:38.935 --> 00:21:41.273
Hey, Gabe.
The kids went to go get pizza

00:21:41.409 --> 00:21:42.605
and I can't get through
on their cells.

00:21:42.741 --> 00:21:43.835
Can I borrow your car
to go find them?

00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:45.504
-How about I drive you?
-Thanks.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.940
Let me get the keys.

00:21:55.321 --> 00:21:57.489
-Who are you?
-Beth.

00:21:58.519 --> 00:21:59.851
Ellie's sister.

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:03.022
Ah, yeah, yeah.
The groupie.

00:22:04.858 --> 00:22:05.761
Let me ask you somethin'.

00:22:07.465 --> 00:22:08.757
Can you hear her up there?

00:22:08.893 --> 00:22:11.433
-What?
-Quake.

00:22:11.569 --> 00:22:13.032
Sent her hiding in the ducts.

00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:17.674
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

00:22:19.474 --> 00:22:21.046
Let's roll.

00:22:23.414 --> 00:22:25.681
Is that them?

00:22:25.817 --> 00:22:27.882
-Good to meet you.

00:22:30.415 --> 00:22:34.059
You never take the elevator
after a quake.

00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:37.189
Bridget dropped the pizza.

00:22:37.324 --> 00:22:40.763
Oh, honey. I love you guys
so much more than pizza.

00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:51.840
The magnitude 5.5 earthquake

00:22:51.976 --> 00:22:53.771
hit just north
of the Puente Hills fault

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.071
less than an hour ago.

00:22:55.206 --> 00:22:56.712
Jolting downtown Los Angeles

00:22:56.848 --> 00:22:58.511
and everywhere from
La Habra to...

00:23:22.072 --> 00:23:24.774
You think it might
be worth something?

00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:26.637
Mom could do with some extra
money right now,

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:28.307
don't you think?

00:23:28.443 --> 00:23:30.278
I don't think Mom wants cash
from something you stole.

00:23:30.413 --> 00:23:32.145
It's not stolen.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.149
It's probably been
locked in that vault forever.

00:23:34.285 --> 00:23:37.050
Yeah, and weird shit like this
gets locked away for a reason.

00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:43.419
Just leave it, Dan.

00:23:45.296 --> 00:23:46.994
Argh! Fuck!

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:49.331
Let me see it.

00:23:49.466 --> 00:23:50.393
It's just a nick.

00:23:59.474 --> 00:24:00.403
Dan...

00:24:26.801 --> 00:24:27.705
Danny, please close it.

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:46.392
I don't like this, Dan.

00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:49.027
You need to put it back
right now.

00:24:49.162 --> 00:24:51.892
Mom's not letting any of us
out the front door
again tonight.

00:24:52.028 --> 00:24:53.027
First thing in the morning
then.

00:24:54.365 --> 00:24:55.359
Promise me?

00:25:09.548 --> 00:25:11.714
You going deep sea diving?

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.379
I gotta see under
before I get in.

00:25:14.514 --> 00:25:17.256
I got stung by a jellyfish
at the beach before.

00:25:17.392 --> 00:25:20.019
I don't like going underwater.

00:25:20.155 --> 00:25:22.018
I don't think
there's any weird

00:25:22.154 --> 00:25:23.728
sea creatures in the tub.

00:25:35.175 --> 00:25:36.398
Oh, my God!

00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:37.971
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

00:25:38.107 --> 00:25:40.603
-It's a... It's a...

00:25:55.195 --> 00:25:56.222
You okay?

00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:58.521
I'm good, sweetie.

00:26:02.362 --> 00:26:04.604
I hate when
my tummy hurts too.

00:27:01.061 --> 00:27:03.187
Good afternoon,
my fellow clergymen.

00:27:03.322 --> 00:27:05.261
I am Father Marcus Littleton,

00:27:05.397 --> 00:27:08.461
the library keeper here
at Saint Patrick's Cathedral

00:27:08.597 --> 00:27:11.532
and I welcome you all today
to the City of Angels.

00:27:12.836 --> 00:27:15.006
You've been invited here

00:27:15.141 --> 00:27:18.175
to witness the unveiling
of a unique artifact

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.236
that was discovered
by our overseas missionaries.

00:27:21.372 --> 00:27:23.147
I would like to present

00:27:23.283 --> 00:27:26.912
what I believe to be one of
the three fabled volumes

00:27:27.048 --> 00:27:28.848
of Naturum Demonto,

00:27:28.983 --> 00:27:31.218
The Book of the Dead.

00:27:33.725 --> 00:27:35.818
My tests to date have revealed

00:27:35.953 --> 00:27:39.392
that its bindings
are made of cured human flesh,

00:27:39.527 --> 00:27:42.224
its passages and etchings
inked in blood.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.769
This is heresy!

00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:45.705
Today,
I seek church approval

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.968
to translate
the spiritual mysteries

00:27:48.103 --> 00:27:49.803
its pages undoubtedly hold.

00:27:49.938 --> 00:27:51.537
Destroy it!

00:27:51.673 --> 00:27:53.409
It's called The Book of
the Dead for a reason!

00:27:53.544 --> 00:27:56.371
I seek to look at
this book for the good of man!

00:28:15.499 --> 00:28:18.227
Rejected by
the elders of our church,

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:21.263
myself, Canon Damien Shanahan,

00:28:21.398 --> 00:28:23.634
and Father Hugo Cortez

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:25.604
have been working in secret
to translate

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.807
The Book of the Dead's
myriad writings and glyphs.

00:28:29.943 --> 00:28:33.748
Its pages contain ancient
rituals and incantations,

00:28:33.884 --> 00:28:35.582
the recitation of which

00:28:35.717 --> 00:28:38.288
proclaim to allow contact
with supernatural forces

00:28:38.424 --> 00:28:41.794
that exist beyond the thin
veneer of our known world.

00:28:55.705 --> 00:28:59.702
It is January 24th
in the year of our Lord, 1923.

00:29:02.179 --> 00:29:04.376
And I,
Father Marcus Littleton,

00:29:04.511 --> 00:29:06.777
shall now commence
reading aloud

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:09.547
the first of the spiritual
resurrection passages.

00:30:40.644 --> 00:30:41.606
Hey!

00:30:42.581 --> 00:30:43.875
Help!

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.284
Help!

00:31:33.798 --> 00:31:35.832
Shut the fuck up!

00:32:52.112 --> 00:32:55.372
It's okay. It's okay.

00:32:55.507 --> 00:32:56.543
It's just a blackout.

00:33:22.202 --> 00:33:23.207
Bridget?

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.209
You all right?

00:33:25.842 --> 00:33:27.572
Yeah.

00:33:27.708 --> 00:33:29.444
Looks like it's just us
that's out.

00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:32.876
Really?

00:33:40.989 --> 00:33:41.951
Mom?

00:33:44.193 --> 00:33:45.196
El, are you sleeping?

00:33:48.933 --> 00:33:50.234
Where is she?

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.407
Mom?

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.156
El?

00:35:08.605 --> 00:35:10.314
What's up, sis?

00:35:15.717 --> 00:35:18.256
I had the most
beautiful dream.

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:23.327
We were together,
sitting in a tall forest.

00:35:25.392 --> 00:35:26.758
The wind was clean

00:35:26.894 --> 00:35:28.761
and the birds were singing
the sweetest...

00:35:37.205 --> 00:35:38.474
Melodies.

00:35:40.172 --> 00:35:43.413
It was a perfect day
and all I could think about

00:35:43.548 --> 00:35:45.917
was how much I wanted
to cut you all open

00:35:46.052 --> 00:35:47.582
and climb inside your bodies

00:35:47.717 --> 00:35:50.046
so that we could stay
one happy family.

00:36:13.945 --> 00:36:14.880
It's in me.

00:36:46.772 --> 00:36:48.914
Don't let it take my babies.

00:36:58.285 --> 00:36:59.881
Mom!

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:01.293
Bridget, take her back inside.

00:37:03.389 --> 00:37:04.593
Now!

00:37:08.058 --> 00:37:09.697
What's wrong with her, Bridge?

00:37:19.245 --> 00:37:21.874
Stairs. Go!
Go, go, go.

00:37:25.777 --> 00:37:26.910
Come on.

00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:28.752
Wake up, Ellie.
Come on, wake up.

00:37:28.887 --> 00:37:30.150
Danny!

00:37:30.286 --> 00:37:31.620
They're gone.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.003
One minute she was fine

00:37:52.138 --> 00:37:54.346
and the next
she was talking crazy and...

00:37:56.148 --> 00:37:57.547
And now she's gone.

00:38:20.964 --> 00:38:22.198
Network's still fucked.

00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:28.479
May I pray?

00:38:30.281 --> 00:38:31.944
She's not religious.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.816
Wasn't.

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.390
It's just a few words.

00:38:40.057 --> 00:38:40.986
Join me.

00:38:53.033 --> 00:38:56.241
Eternal rest grant unto her,
O Lord

00:38:56.377 --> 00:38:58.740
and let perpetual light
shine upon her.

00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.073
May her soul

00:39:02.208 --> 00:39:04.576
and the souls
of all the faithful departed

00:39:04.712 --> 00:39:05.910
through the mercy of God--

00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:07.452
What the hell happened
to her face?

00:39:09.682 --> 00:39:10.719
Rest in peace.

00:39:12.656 --> 00:39:14.250
Looks like someone
beat her up.

00:39:16.826 --> 00:39:19.330
There's an old fire-escape
ladder

00:39:19.466 --> 00:39:21.495
on the north side
of the building.

00:39:21.631 --> 00:39:23.829
I could try to get down that,

00:39:23.965 --> 00:39:25.894
raise the alarm,
get some help in here.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.333
You have to go through 82.

00:39:27.468 --> 00:39:28.506
Ah, shit.

00:39:29.638 --> 00:39:30.935
That's unoccupied, right?

00:39:31.071 --> 00:39:33.038
Yeah. Like most of this
condemned dump.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.382
You got the tools?

00:39:37.518 --> 00:39:39.350
We could just cut right
through the door.

00:39:39.485 --> 00:39:41.276
In my truck.

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:42.648
You ain't gettin' through
those old doors

00:39:42.784 --> 00:39:44.247
without something heavy-duty.

00:39:50.053 --> 00:39:52.094
I want Dad to come home.

00:39:55.396 --> 00:39:56.391
He will.

00:39:58.433 --> 00:40:00.433
When we get the phones working
again, he'll come right back.

00:40:00.569 --> 00:40:01.935
How do you know he will?

00:40:03.872 --> 00:40:05.838
You said Mom
was gonna be okay.

00:40:05.973 --> 00:40:07.902
I thought she would be.

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:10.009
I'm so sorry, Kass.

00:40:14.052 --> 00:40:16.077
I'm gonna get my shotgun,
and we're gonna blast it open.

00:40:16.212 --> 00:40:17.753
Just give me a minute, okay?

00:40:18.786 --> 00:40:20.124
I don't like being trapped.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.458
Everyone is on edge enough

00:40:21.593 --> 00:40:23.286
without guns getting fired
in here.

00:41:01.833 --> 00:41:05.332
I don't know what to do, El.

00:41:05.467 --> 00:41:08.540
You're the one
who always has the answers.

00:41:12.702 --> 00:41:15.943
I'm too scared to even face
your kids right now.

00:41:27.286 --> 00:41:29.227
No matter how busy
you ever got,

00:41:29.363 --> 00:41:31.387
you always found time for me.

00:41:32.825 --> 00:41:34.126
For everyone.

00:41:38.432 --> 00:41:41.166
I can't believe I'm never
gonna speak to you again.

00:41:43.468 --> 00:41:46.501
Hey, Bethy-boo. It's Ellie.

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:50.674
Just... calling to say hi.
And, uh...

00:41:50.809 --> 00:41:51.774
Beth.

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:53.377
Beth!

00:41:53.512 --> 00:41:55.710
You have to help me, Beth.
You have to.

00:41:55.845 --> 00:41:58.386
-I'm burning.
I'm burning alive!

00:42:23.907 --> 00:42:24.913
El?

00:42:34.922 --> 00:42:36.628
-Mom?
-She's alive?

00:42:37.758 --> 00:42:39.092
She's burning up.

00:42:49.902 --> 00:42:50.999
I'll get ice.

00:44:03.611 --> 00:44:04.507
Mom?

00:44:06.117 --> 00:44:08.181
Mommy's with the maggots now.

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:09.880
Mom, stop it!

00:45:15.555 --> 00:45:17.452
-Stop it!

00:45:22.259 --> 00:45:23.993
It's not my fault, Bridget.

00:45:26.533 --> 00:45:28.765
Get away from her, Bridge!

00:45:28.901 --> 00:45:31.434
What's happening to me,
sweetheart?

00:45:31.569 --> 00:45:32.628
I don't know, Mom.

00:45:35.406 --> 00:45:36.533
I do.

00:45:43.108 --> 00:45:44.277
I'm free now.

00:45:46.447 --> 00:45:49.084
Free from all you
titty-sucking parasites.

00:46:17.583 --> 00:46:18.711
Let me kiss it better.

00:46:44.934 --> 00:46:46.845
Who wants to rot next?

00:46:49.073 --> 00:46:50.277
Eeny...

00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.514
meeny...

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:55.854
miny...

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:00.353
You.

00:47:01.988 --> 00:47:03.559
Ellie?

00:47:21.347 --> 00:47:22.342
Fuck!

00:48:11.059 --> 00:48:12.421
Grab the cabinet.

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:20.829
Get away from the door.

00:49:04.081 --> 00:49:05.306
Please, we need help!

00:49:05.441 --> 00:49:07.144
Let me in!

00:49:58.295 --> 00:49:59.532
Hello!

00:50:02.036 --> 00:50:04.141
Can you hear me?

00:50:15.084 --> 00:50:17.550
Don't you think Mom looks
just like one of those pictures
from that book?

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.017
Answer me, Danny.

00:50:29.166 --> 00:50:31.096
You never should've stolen it.

00:50:31.232 --> 00:50:32.460
This isn't my fault.

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:34.270
This is your fault!

00:50:34.405 --> 00:50:36.765
-Get off me! Get off!
Stop it!

00:50:36.901 --> 00:50:38.901
-Hey! Hey, hey!
-This is all your fault!

00:50:39.579 --> 00:50:40.672
Hey. Hey.

00:50:43.477 --> 00:50:45.281
You don't turn on each other.

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:48.911
Ever.

00:50:50.517 --> 00:50:52.519
I need to show you something.

00:51:11.074 --> 00:51:12.473
What is this, Danny?

00:51:21.888 --> 00:51:23.154
Does it hurt bad?

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:27.488
Bridget?

00:51:30.993 --> 00:51:32.196
I'm okay.

00:52:55.012 --> 00:52:57.081
I took these too.

00:52:57.216 --> 00:52:58.708
There's this creepy priest
on them,

00:52:58.843 --> 00:53:00.082
reading passages
from the book.

00:53:00.218 --> 00:53:01.978
It's like a weird dark prayer.

00:53:03.012 --> 00:53:04.651
And when he spoke the words...

00:53:09.956 --> 00:53:13.022
Bridget's right.
This is all my fault.

Hey there, cutie-pie.

00:54:19.098 --> 00:54:21.255
What's wrong with you, Mom?

00:54:23.436 --> 00:54:27.838
I was just feeling sad about
me and your dad.

00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:29.202
But he's here now.

00:54:29.338 --> 00:54:31.305
He came home to see us.

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.135
We're getting back together.

00:54:34.772 --> 00:54:36.171
We love each other.

00:54:38.283 --> 00:54:39.977
Isn't that right, my darling?

00:54:47.917 --> 00:54:50.091
And we love you too.

00:55:19.148 --> 00:55:21.425
Open up and let us in, Kassie.

00:55:23.627 --> 00:55:26.188
We can be a big,
happy family again.

00:55:28.299 --> 00:55:30.258
You don't look so good, Mom.

00:55:32.068 --> 00:55:33.603
Oh.

00:55:33.739 --> 00:55:37.771
Nothing a big old hug and kiss
from you won't fix.

00:55:39.373 --> 00:55:40.675
Open up now,

00:55:41.376 --> 00:55:43.040
like a good girl.

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.049
That's it.

00:55:53.223 --> 00:55:54.491
Come on, now.

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:59.496
Do it for Mom and Dad.

00:56:13.672 --> 00:56:14.709
Mom!

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.825
-You okay?
-I'm sorry.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.394
I thought Mom was better.

00:56:37.398 --> 00:56:39.069
Open the door
like you open your legs,

00:56:39.205 --> 00:56:40.603
you stinking groupie slut!

00:56:44.103 --> 00:56:48.512
I'm not a groupie,
you psycho bitch!

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:54.914
Beth.

00:56:58.088 --> 00:56:59.083
Beth.

00:57:02.084 --> 00:57:03.494
Go to your room.

00:57:21.312 --> 00:57:22.942
It'll be okay, Danny.

00:57:27.113 --> 00:57:29.546
Staffanie will protect us.
Right?

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:37.693
Yeah.

00:58:20.373 --> 00:58:22.232
What are you looking at, hon?

00:58:43.092 --> 00:58:44.789
I gotta
kill the creepy-crawlies

00:58:44.924 --> 00:58:46.927
that I got inside my tummy.

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:01.579
I don't like having things
inside my tummy.

00:59:08.254 --> 00:59:10.053
Do you, Auntie Beth?

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.014
Hey.

01:01:22.388 --> 01:01:23.644
Is this a nightmare?

01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:28.253
It's just like a nightmare,
Kass.

01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:33.760
Is what happened to Bridget
and Mom gonna happen to us?

01:01:33.896 --> 01:01:35.425
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:01:36.532 --> 01:01:37.735
I promise.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:43.631
You'd be a good mom someday,
Auntie Beth.

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.803
Oh, yeah?

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:48.944
Yeah.

01:01:50.714 --> 01:01:52.706
You know how to lie to kids.

01:02:21.009 --> 01:02:22.604
I thought I should tie her up.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.882
Just in case.

01:02:29.886 --> 01:02:31.888
I wanna listen to that vinyl.

01:02:33.385 --> 01:02:35.925
It's too dangerous.
Those words...

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:38.695
Yeah, well, maybe
there's words on there

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:41.656
that can help stop
all of this.

01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:46.364
We've got no power
to run a turntable.

01:02:48.769 --> 01:02:50.104
I can fix that.

01:03:10.793 --> 01:03:13.787
I listened to the first
and then he spoke the words
on the second.

01:03:17.729 --> 01:03:20.629
I guess I'll start
at the other end, then.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:27.537
Just in case.

01:03:58.339 --> 01:03:59.733
It is now two nights

01:03:59.868 --> 01:04:02.576
since I read aloud
from the book.

01:04:02.711 --> 01:04:05.542
My want to understand and
commune with the other side

01:04:05.677 --> 01:04:08.575
could not have been
more misguided.

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:10.681
I make this final recording

01:04:10.817 --> 01:04:13.381
as a warning to whoever next
comes into contact

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.156
with its malignant pages.

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:20.691
Naturum Demonto
cannot be destroyed.

01:04:20.827 --> 01:04:25.027
When you find it, bury it deep
in our secret vault,

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:28.562
for the words I uttered have
unleashed a demonic entity

01:04:28.697 --> 01:04:30.435
beyond my darkest nightmare.

01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:35.605
Is Bridget gonna
come back like Mom?

01:04:38.848 --> 01:04:40.412
I don't know, Kass.

01:04:43.353 --> 01:04:46.055
The demon possessed
Cortez first,

01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:47.925
rotting him
from the inside out.

01:04:55.365 --> 01:04:56.791
With the might of
our Lord's words,

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:59.295
we tried to drive out
the foul entity

01:04:59.431 --> 01:05:01.268
but it mocked our prayers

01:05:01.404 --> 01:05:03.435
and took Shanahan
under its control.

01:05:06.241 --> 01:05:08.937
Fellow priests
came to our aid

01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:10.746
but the possession quickly
spread amongst them

01:05:10.882 --> 01:05:12.774
without rhyme nor reason.

01:05:26.926 --> 01:05:30.799
This evil is not governed
by the rules of man.

01:05:30.935 --> 01:05:33.433
No, it takes its pleasure

01:05:33.568 --> 01:05:36.798
in creating terror
through total chaos.

01:05:42.441 --> 01:05:44.840
Desperate to end this curse,

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:48.614
I tried to kill what were once
my brothers.

01:05:48.749 --> 01:05:51.516
I led them to the woodshed
and set it ablaze.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.548
But they danced in its flame

01:05:54.683 --> 01:05:56.856
and reveled in its burn.

01:06:22.253 --> 01:06:25.055
Mr. Fonda's kitty hides up
there sometimes.

01:06:26.957 --> 01:06:29.954
I don't think it's a cat.

01:06:30.089 --> 01:06:32.519
I buried their
squirming, spitting corpses

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:33.860
in consecrated earth.

01:06:35.966 --> 01:06:37.866
But they arose again,

01:06:38.001 --> 01:06:39.729
rotting and rage-filled.

01:06:47.538 --> 01:06:49.706
-Careful, Danny.

01:07:34.988 --> 01:07:37.556
After hiding
in the cellar for a night,

01:07:37.691 --> 01:07:39.756
I knew only
one choice remained.

01:07:41.361 --> 01:07:44.101
Complete bodily dismemberment.

01:08:04.449 --> 01:08:07.014
Told you, you should've
put the book back, Danny.

01:08:23.367 --> 01:08:27.276
I chopped, and I hacked,
and I...

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:30.646
I failed.

01:08:33.884 --> 01:08:38.146
I can hear them
outside the doors now,
begging for me.

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:42.423
It is only a matter of time
before I am taken too.

01:08:42.559 --> 01:08:46.329
Nothing can stop
this demonic force.

01:08:46.464 --> 01:08:49.199
Even its final remnants
will come after you.

01:08:50.428 --> 01:08:51.834
You must run.

01:08:51.969 --> 01:08:54.204
All you can do is run!

01:09:04.514 --> 01:09:06.543
This horror will not stop

01:09:06.678 --> 01:09:08.713
until innocence is destroyed.

01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:11.715
Until evil...

01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:13.852
...be thy name.

01:09:35.175 --> 01:09:36.004
Danny.

01:09:40.378 --> 01:09:42.542
I'm sorry, Kass.

01:09:50.594 --> 01:09:53.263
I will swallow your soul.

01:10:13.444 --> 01:10:14.911
Two souls?

01:10:20.287 --> 01:10:22.020
Please. El...

01:10:22.155 --> 01:10:25.924
Ellie waits in hell for you
and your unborn bastard baby.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.055
No.

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:34.931
Auntie Beth!

01:10:57.225 --> 01:10:58.361
Are you hurt?

01:11:02.968 --> 01:11:04.631
Are you gonna be a mom?

01:11:13.305 --> 01:11:14.311
Yes.

01:11:17.843 --> 01:11:19.712
And I'm getting us
out of here.

01:11:21.016 --> 01:11:22.110
How?

01:11:55.484 --> 01:11:56.809
Fire escape. Let's go.

01:12:05.624 --> 01:12:08.057
Don't look back there.

01:13:14.628 --> 01:13:16.466
Get back. Cover your ears.

01:13:21.402 --> 01:13:22.399
Bethy-boo!

01:13:39.283 --> 01:13:40.455
She's trying to take

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:42.316
your mommy away
from you, Kassie.

01:13:44.395 --> 01:13:46.419
I know you're not my mom
anymore.

01:13:52.698 --> 01:13:54.130
Don't take me from them.

01:13:55.967 --> 01:13:57.497
You have no idea
what it's like

01:13:57.633 --> 01:14:00.004
to bring a child into
this world, Beth.

01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:08.848
That's my gun,
you thieving cunt.

01:14:15.457 --> 01:14:16.317
Auntie Beth!

01:14:17.127 --> 01:14:18.352
Auntie Beth!

01:14:40.413 --> 01:14:43.619
Everybody here
dies by dawn, Beth.

01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:46.389
Run!

01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:47.887
Dead by dawn!

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.989
Dead by dawn!

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:53.695
-Dead by dawn!
-By dawn!

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.863
Dead by dawn!

01:14:57.927 --> 01:14:59.727
Dead by dawn!

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:02.103
Dead by dawn!

01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:03.335
Dead by dawn!

01:15:05.143 --> 01:15:07.038
Dead by dawn!

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.205
Dead by dawn!

01:15:10.577 --> 01:15:12.549
Dead by dawn!

01:15:17.153 --> 01:15:18.219
Here.

01:16:27.217 --> 01:16:29.751
No way out!

01:16:29.886 --> 01:16:32.490
No way out!

01:16:32.625 --> 01:16:34.730
No way out!

01:16:45.202 --> 01:16:46.643
-Auntie Beth!
-Come here!

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.618
-No!

01:18:00.383 --> 01:18:02.345
Kassie. Kassie.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.087
Kassie. Kassie. Kassie.

01:18:13.561 --> 01:18:14.555
Am I dead?

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.412
Come on. Get in.

01:18:59.841 --> 01:19:01.107
Kass, where's the beeper?

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:11.645
Come on. Come on.

01:19:32.574 --> 01:19:33.502
It's coming.

01:21:28.382 --> 01:21:29.222
Get under!

01:21:39.931 --> 01:21:41.333
Kassie!

01:22:17.298 --> 01:22:20.267
All I want
is your little head, baby girl.

01:22:41.566 --> 01:22:43.032
Come get some.

01:24:08.114 --> 01:24:09.948
Turn it on, Kass!

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:04.800
Please.

01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:07.605
Help me, Bethy-boo.

01:25:09.741 --> 01:25:13.642
Only my sister
gets to call me that.

01:25:47.811 --> 01:25:50.010
You know, you really do
look like Mom.

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:56.253
And you're gonna fail
miserably just like her.

01:25:56.389 --> 01:25:57.822
You stinking, horrible...

01:25:57.957 --> 01:26:00.229
...groupie cunt!

01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:33.213
There's been no cell signal

01:28:33.349 --> 01:28:34.478
until, like, five minutes ago

01:28:34.614 --> 01:28:35.978
and the thunder kept me awake,

01:28:36.113 --> 01:28:38.519
so I got basically
less than zero sleep.

01:28:38.654 --> 01:28:41.216
Anyway, all my early morning
moans aside,

01:28:41.352 --> 01:28:44.787
we are still gonna have such
a fab weekend at the lake.

01:28:44.922 --> 01:28:46.693
Caleb's dad's cabin
is so awesome,

01:28:46.828 --> 01:28:49.123
and you're gonna absolutely
love his friends.

01:28:51.194 --> 01:28:53.327
I'm sure one of them
will be perfect for you.

01:28:53.463 --> 01:28:55.395
I don't mean to be
a downer or anything

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:57.699
but I was actually thinking
of taking a rain check

01:28:57.835 --> 01:29:00.039
on this whole trip thing.

01:29:00.175 --> 01:29:01.042
Not a chance.

01:29:01.178 --> 01:29:02.644
I'm picking you up in 15.

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:03.742
Bye!

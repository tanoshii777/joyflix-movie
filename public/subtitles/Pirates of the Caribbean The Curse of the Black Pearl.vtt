WEBVTT

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:34.070
Drink up, me hearties,
yo ho

00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:38.744
We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:42.687
Drink up, me hearties,
yo ho

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:46.192
Yo ho, yo ho

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.696
A pirate's life for me

00:00:49.763 --> 00:00:54.097
We extort, we pilfer,
we filch and sack

00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:55.260
Drink up

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:56.598
Quiet, missy.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.264
Cursed pirates sail
these waters.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.035
You don't want to bring them.

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:03.736
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.041
She was singing about pirates.

00:01:06.113 --> 00:01:07.842
It's bad luck to be singing
about pirates

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:09.974
with us mired
in this unnatural fog.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.210
Mark my words.

00:01:11.285 --> 00:01:13.219
Consider them marked.

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:15.583
On your way.

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:16.748
Aye, Lieutenant.

00:01:16.824 --> 00:01:19.418
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board, too.

00:01:19.493 --> 00:01:22.223
Even a miniature one.

00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:25.527
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:28.624
Think again, Miss Swann.

00:01:28.702 --> 00:01:31.432
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of them.

00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:34.565
I intend that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:38.509
or wears a pirate brand gets
what he deserves.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.514
A short drop and a sudden stop.

00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:46.877
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor,

00:01:46.954 --> 00:01:49.650
but I'm concerned
about the effect

00:01:49.723 --> 00:01:52.089
this subject will have
upon my daughter.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.024
My apologies, Governor Swann.

00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:56.119
Actually,
I find it all fascinating.

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:58.824
Yes.
That's what concerns me.

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:28.759
Look! A boy!
There's a boy in the water!

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:33.198
Man overboard!

00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:36.733
Man the ropes.
Fetch a hook.

00:02:36.804 --> 00:02:38.635
Haul him aboard.

00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:48.876
He's still breathing.

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:51.577
Mary, Mother of God.

00:02:57.758 --> 00:03:00.454
What happened here?

00:03:00.527 --> 00:03:01.926
It's the powder magazine.

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.395
Merchant vessels run
heavily armed.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.734
A lot of good it did them.

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:11.464
Everyone's thinking it.
I'm just saying it.

00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:14.132
Pirates.

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:17.666
There's no proof of that.
It's probably an accident.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.642
Rouse the captain immediately.

00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:23.774
Heave to and take in sail.
Launch the boats.

00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:29.881
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:32.016
He'll be in your charge.

00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:33.719
Take care of him.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.105
It's okay.

00:03:55.182 --> 00:03:57.946
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

00:03:58.018 --> 00:04:00.543
Will Turner.

00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:02.555
I'm watching over you, Will.

00:04:15.202 --> 00:04:17.363
You're a pirate.

00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:19.337
Has he said anything?

00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:23.570
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:25.771
Take him below.

00:05:35.215 --> 00:05:36.978
Elizabeth?

00:05:38.852 --> 00:05:41.446
Are you all right?

00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:43.284
Are you decent?

00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:44.654
Yes.

00:05:44.725 --> 00:05:46.522
Yes.

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:49.653
Still abed at this hour?

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.198
Oh, it's a beautiful day.

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:56.128
I have a gift for you.

00:05:58.772 --> 00:06:00.637
Oh, it's beautiful.

00:06:00.707 --> 00:06:02.038
lsn't it?

00:06:03.477 --> 00:06:05.536
May I inquire
as to the occasion?

00:06:05.612 --> 00:06:08.979
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.376
Go on.

00:06:14.588 --> 00:06:16.249
Actually, l...

00:06:17.758 --> 00:06:20.352
I hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:21.758
The ceremony?

00:06:21.828 --> 00:06:24.626
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

00:06:24.698 --> 00:06:25.528
I knew it.

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:28.898
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.699
A fine gentleman,
don't you think?

00:06:31.772 --> 00:06:34.036
He fancies you, you know.

00:06:34.107 --> 00:06:37.076
Elizabeth?
How's it coming?

00:06:37.144 --> 00:06:39.578
It's difficult to say.

00:06:39.646 --> 00:06:42.046
I'm told it's the latest fashion
in London.

00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:46.017
Well, women in London
must've learnt not to breathe.

00:06:47.454 --> 00:06:49.222
Milord, you have a visitor.

00:07:07.374 --> 00:07:08.602
Mr. Turner.

00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:10.267
Good to see you again.

00:07:10.343 --> 00:07:11.935
Good day, sir.

00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:14.811
I have your order.

00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:20.744
Well.

00:07:20.821 --> 00:07:23.085
The blade is folded steel.

00:07:23.156 --> 00:07:26.353
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:28.155
If I may.

00:07:30.397 --> 00:07:31.431
Perfectly balanced.

00:07:31.998 --> 00:07:35.195
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

00:07:37.337 --> 00:07:39.737
lmpressive.
Very impressive.

00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:41.398
Now, now.

00:07:41.475 --> 00:07:45.571
Commodore Norrington is going
to be very pleased with this.

00:07:45.645 --> 00:07:48.842
Do pass my compliments on
to your master.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.443
I shall.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:56.319
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

00:07:57.591 --> 00:08:01.425
Elizabeth,
you look absolutely stunning.

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:03.122
Will.

00:08:03.196 --> 00:08:05.721
It's so good to see you.

00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:08.097
I had a dream about you
last night.

00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:08.964
About me?

00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:11.196
Yes, is that entirely proper
for you --

00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:13.398
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

00:08:13.473 --> 00:08:15.464
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:18.568
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

00:08:18.645 --> 00:08:22.308
At least once more,
Miss Swann, as always.

00:08:22.382 --> 00:08:23.508
There. See?

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:25.949
At least the boy has a sense
of propriety.

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:29.614
We really must be going.
There you are.

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:31.680
Good day, Mr. Turner.

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:35.026
Come along.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.422
Good day.

00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:42.492
Elizabeth.

00:10:11.858 --> 00:10:13.348
What -- hey.

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:16.293
Hold up, there, you.

00:10:16.363 --> 00:10:20.424
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat at the dock.

00:10:22.202 --> 00:10:24.295
And I shall need to know
your name.

00:10:26.206 --> 00:10:28.572
What do you say
to three shillings,

00:10:28.642 --> 00:10:30.576
and we forget the name?

00:10:33.747 --> 00:10:36.477
Welcome to Port Royal,
Mr. Smith.

00:11:12.052 --> 00:11:14.577
Two paces march!

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:19.085
Right about-face!

00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:24.329
Present arms!

00:11:47.854 --> 00:11:50.516
This dock is off limits
to civilians.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.387
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't know.

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:55.362
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

00:11:58.798 --> 00:12:02.393
There's some sort of high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort.

00:12:02.469 --> 00:12:05.734
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen such as yourselves

00:12:05.805 --> 00:12:08.569
did not merit an invitation?

00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:11.633
Someone has to make sure
this dock stays off limits.

00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:13.508
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.744
But it seems to me
that a ship like that

00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:21.150
makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:24.088
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true.

00:12:24.157 --> 00:12:27.524
But there's no ship as can match
the Interceptor for speed.

00:12:27.594 --> 00:12:28.686
I've heard of one.

00:12:28.762 --> 00:12:32.027
It's supposed to be very fast.
Nigh uncatchable.

00:12:32.098 --> 00:12:33.861
The Black Pearl,

00:12:35.001 --> 00:12:40.633
Well, there's no real ship
as can match the Interceptor,

00:12:40.707 --> 00:12:42.675
Black Pearl is a real ship.

00:12:42.742 --> 00:12:44.539
No.
No, it's not.

00:12:44.611 --> 00:12:46.306
Yes, it is.
I've seen it.

00:12:46.379 --> 00:12:47.812
You've seen it?

00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:48.745
Yes.

00:12:48.815 --> 00:12:50.783
You haven't seen it.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.044
Yes, I have.

00:12:52.118 --> 00:12:55.349
You've seen a ship
with black sails

00:12:55.422 --> 00:12:59.825
that's crewed by the damned
and captained by a man so evil

00:12:59.893 --> 00:13:03.226
that Hell itself
spat him back out?

00:13:03.296 --> 00:13:04.490
No.

00:13:04.564 --> 00:13:06.031
No.

00:13:06.099 --> 00:13:08.431
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:09.399
Oh.

00:13:09.469 --> 00:13:11.630
No ship that's not crewed
by the damned

00:13:11.704 --> 00:13:14.571
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell spat him out

00:13:14.641 --> 00:13:17.701
could possibly have black sails,
therefore couldn't be

00:13:17.777 --> 00:13:19.074
any other ship
than the Black Pearl,

00:13:19.145 --> 00:13:21.909
Is that what you're saying?

00:13:21.981 --> 00:13:23.107
No.

00:13:23.183 --> 00:13:26.050
Like I said,
there's no real ship

00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:28.610
as can match the Interceptor,

00:13:30.523 --> 00:13:32.184
Hey!

00:13:32.258 --> 00:13:33.657
You!

00:13:34.727 --> 00:13:35.853
Get away from there!

00:13:35.929 --> 00:13:38.295
You don't have permission
to be there.

00:13:38.364 --> 00:13:40.628
I'm sorry.
It's such a pretty boat.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.792
Ship.

00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:42.857
What's your name?

00:13:42.936 --> 00:13:45.496
Smith.
Or Smithy, if you like.

00:13:45.572 --> 00:13:48.939
What's your purpose
in Port Royal, Mr. Smith?

00:13:49.008 --> 00:13:50.134
Yeah.
And no lies.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.611
Well, then, I confess.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.705
It is my intention to
commandeer one of these ships,

00:13:55.782 --> 00:13:57.682
pick up a crew in Tortuga,
raid, pillage, plunder,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.513
and otherwise pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

00:14:00.587 --> 00:14:03.886
-I said no lies.
-I think he's telling the truth.

00:14:03.957 --> 00:14:07.620
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:12.097
Unless you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:24.205
May I have a moment?

00:14:32.685 --> 00:14:34.778
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

00:14:36.923 --> 00:14:42.725
I apologize if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

00:14:45.265 --> 00:14:47.756
This promotion throws
into sharp relief

00:14:47.834 --> 00:14:51.565
that which I have not yet
achieved.

00:14:53.306 --> 00:14:55.774
A marriage to a fine woman.

00:14:56.676 --> 00:14:59.770
You have become
a fine woman, Elizabeth.

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:01.780
I can't breathe.

00:15:01.848 --> 00:15:05.750
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

00:15:07.587 --> 00:15:09.851
And then they made me
their chief.

00:15:12.258 --> 00:15:13.953
Elizabeth?

00:15:16.029 --> 00:15:16.961
Elizabeth!

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.964
My God.

00:15:19.032 --> 00:15:19.760
The rocks!

00:15:19.832 --> 00:15:22.357
Sir, it's a miracle
she missed them.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.371
-Will you be saving her?
-I can't swim.

00:15:29.042 --> 00:15:31.272
Pride of the King's Navy,
you are.

00:15:31.344 --> 00:15:33.244
Do not lose these.

00:15:47.393 --> 00:15:49.452
What was that?

00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:24.521
Make way!

00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:32.899
I got her!

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.130
She's not breathing!

00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:36.766
Move!

00:16:42.348 --> 00:16:44.782
I never would've thought
of that.

00:16:44.851 --> 00:16:47.217
Clearly you've never been
to Singapore.

00:16:52.425 --> 00:16:54.916
Where did you get that?

00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:57.822
On your feet.

00:17:00.033 --> 00:17:01.227
Elizabeth!

00:17:02.535 --> 00:17:03.524
Are you all right?

00:17:03.603 --> 00:17:04.968
Yes, I'm fine.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:10.371
Shoot him.

00:17:10.443 --> 00:17:11.375
-Father.
-What?

00:17:11.444 --> 00:17:14.936
Commodore, do you really
intend to kill my rescuer?

00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:23.953
I believe thanks are in order.

00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:32.191
Had a brush with the East lndia
Trading Company, did we, pirate?

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:34.698
Hang him.

00:17:34.767 --> 00:17:38.965
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:40.164
Well, well.

00:17:40.239 --> 00:17:42.639
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:45.610
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

00:17:45.678 --> 00:17:48.613
Well, I don't see
your ship, Captain.

00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:51.047
I'm in the market, as it were.

00:17:51.117 --> 00:17:53.017
He said he'd come
to commandeer one.

00:17:53.086 --> 00:17:56.715
Told you he was telling
the truth. These are his, sir.

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:02.555
No additional shot nor powder.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.955
A compass
that doesn't point North.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.537
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

00:18:16.442 --> 00:18:20.310
You are without doubt the worst
pirate I've ever heard of.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.473
But you have heard of me.

00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:27.219
Commodore,
I really must protest.

00:18:27.286 --> 00:18:28.913
Carefully, Lieutenant.

00:18:28.988 --> 00:18:31.252
Pirate or not,
this man saved my life.

00:18:31.324 --> 00:18:34.825
One good deed is not enough
to redeem a man

00:18:34.894 --> 00:18:37.124
Though it seems enough
to condemn him.

00:18:37.196 --> 00:18:39.599
lndeed.

00:18:39.599 --> 00:18:40.964
Finally.

00:18:41.467 --> 00:18:42.491
No.

00:18:42.568 --> 00:18:43.535
No! Don't shoot!

00:18:43.603 --> 00:18:45.594
I knew you'd warm up to me.

00:18:45.671 --> 00:18:47.969
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.473
And my hat.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.741
Commodore.

00:18:54.313 --> 00:18:57.476
-lt is Elizabeth, isn't it?
-It's Miss Swann.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.780
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

00:18:59.852 --> 00:19:02.650
Come, come, dear.
We don't have all day.

00:19:04.223 --> 00:19:06.384
Now if you'll be very kind.

00:19:22.742 --> 00:19:24.869
Easy on the goods, darling.

00:19:25.611 --> 00:19:27.010
You're despicable.

00:19:27.079 --> 00:19:29.104
Sticks and stones, love.

00:19:29.182 --> 00:19:32.777
I saved your life.
You save mine. We're square.

00:19:32.852 --> 00:19:36.344
Gentlemen, milady,
you will always remember this

00:19:36.422 --> 00:19:41.485
as the day that you almost
caught Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:19:58.077 --> 00:20:00.045
Whoa!

00:20:00.112 --> 00:20:01.841
Now will you shoot him?

00:20:01.914 --> 00:20:04.041
Open fire!

00:20:05.084 --> 00:20:06.210
Hey!

00:20:10.623 --> 00:20:12.750
On his heels!

00:20:28.207 --> 00:20:30.141
Take cover, man!

00:20:30.209 --> 00:20:34.805
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

00:20:34.881 --> 00:20:37.441
I would hate for him to miss it.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.387
Search upstairs!

00:20:43.456 --> 00:20:45.287
Look lively, men!

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:28.289
Whoa!

00:22:17.883 --> 00:22:20.113
Right where I left you.

00:22:26.692 --> 00:22:29.183
Not where I left you.

00:22:38.904 --> 00:22:40.735
You're the one they're hunting.

00:22:41.841 --> 00:22:43.809
The pirate.

00:22:43.876 --> 00:22:46.868
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

00:22:46.946 --> 00:22:50.712
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

00:22:50.783 --> 00:22:53.547
It would be a shame to
put a mark on your record.

00:22:53.619 --> 00:22:55.484
So if you'll excuse me.

00:22:59.191 --> 00:23:01.557
Do you think this wise, boy?

00:23:01.627 --> 00:23:04.755
Crossing blades with a pirate?

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.094
You threatened Miss Swann.

00:23:09.402 --> 00:23:12.098
Only a little.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.311
You know what you're doing. I'll
give you that. Excellent form.

00:23:28.387 --> 00:23:30.855
But how's your footwork?

00:23:30.923 --> 00:23:32.982
If I step here.

00:23:33.626 --> 00:23:35.025
Very good.

00:23:35.094 --> 00:23:37.119
And now I step again.

00:23:42.368 --> 00:23:43.232
Ta.

00:24:03.255 --> 00:24:05.849
That is a wonderful trick.

00:24:05.925 --> 00:24:09.759
Except, once again, you are
between me and my way out.

00:24:09.829 --> 00:24:12.957
And now you have no weapon.

00:24:35.354 --> 00:24:36.946
Who makes all these?

00:24:38.557 --> 00:24:39.751
I do.

00:24:39.825 --> 00:24:44.421
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

00:24:45.097 --> 00:24:47.691
You need to find yourself
a girl, mate.

00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:57.298
Or perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

00:24:57.376 --> 00:24:58.707
is that you found one

00:24:58.811 --> 00:25:03.180
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

00:25:03.249 --> 00:25:05.444
You're not a eunuch, are you?

00:25:05.484 --> 00:25:08.544
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate,

00:25:08.687 --> 00:25:09.949
I can kill it!

00:26:27.266 --> 00:26:28.255
You cheated.

00:26:28.334 --> 00:26:29.596
Pirate.

00:26:33.172 --> 00:26:34.298
Move away.

00:26:34.373 --> 00:26:35.704
No.

00:26:35.774 --> 00:26:37.469
-Please move.
-No.

00:26:37.543 --> 00:26:40.569
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

00:26:43.048 --> 00:26:45.812
This shot is not meant for you.

00:26:55.294 --> 00:26:58.127
There he is! Over here!

00:26:59.465 --> 00:27:02.457
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

00:27:02.534 --> 00:27:05.264
You've assisted in the capture
of a fugitive.

00:27:05.337 --> 00:27:08.636
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

00:27:08.707 --> 00:27:11.232
I trust you will
remember this is the day

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.939
Captain Jack Sparrow
almost escaped.

00:27:15.014 --> 00:27:16.504
Take him away.

00:27:22.049 --> 00:27:23.516
-Can you smell it?
-Come here.

00:27:23.584 --> 00:27:25.279
-It's marrowbone.
-Come here.

00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:27.150
-Want a juicy bone?
-Come here.

00:27:27.221 --> 00:27:30.054
-Come here, boy!
-Come on.

00:27:30.124 --> 00:27:34.060
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

00:27:34.128 --> 00:27:35.254
Oh, excuse us

00:27:35.329 --> 00:27:38.594
if we haven't resigned ourselves
to the gallows just yet.

00:27:45.006 --> 00:27:46.701
There you go, miss.

00:27:46.774 --> 00:27:49.402
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

00:27:49.477 --> 00:27:52.139
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose.

00:27:52.213 --> 00:27:54.773
I must admit,
I wasn't prepared for it.

00:27:54.849 --> 00:27:58.808
I meant you being threatened by
that pirate. Sounds terrifying.

00:27:58.886 --> 00:28:00.376
Oh.

00:28:00.454 --> 00:28:02.217
Yes, it was terrifying.

00:28:02.289 --> 00:28:05.554
But the commodore proposed.
Fancy that.

00:28:05.626 --> 00:28:09.357
Now, that's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.160
It is a smart match.

00:28:12.233 --> 00:28:14.224
He's a fine man.

00:28:15.236 --> 00:28:18.694
He's what any woman should dream
of marrying.

00:28:18.773 --> 00:28:23.039
Well, that Will Turner.
He's a fine man, too.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.044
That is too bold.

00:28:25.112 --> 00:28:29.014
Well, begging your pardon, miss.
It was not my place.

00:29:17.832 --> 00:29:20.767
Has my daughter given you
an answer yet?

00:29:20.835 --> 00:29:22.700
No, she hasn't.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.739
Well, she has had
a very trying day.

00:29:26.807 --> 00:29:28.968
Ghastly weather,
don't you think?

00:29:29.043 --> 00:29:30.806
Bleak. Very bleak.

00:29:32.546 --> 00:29:34.639
What's that?

00:29:34.715 --> 00:29:36.706
Cannon fire!

00:29:37.785 --> 00:29:39.878
Return fire!

00:29:39.954 --> 00:29:42.582
-I know those guns.
-Men to arms!

00:29:47.962 --> 00:29:49.953
It's the Pearl,

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.089
The Black Pearl?

00:29:54.034 --> 00:29:55.865
I've heard stories.

00:29:55.936 --> 00:29:59.702
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near 10 years.

00:29:59.774 --> 00:30:01.298
Never leaves any survivors.

00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:03.639
No survivors?

00:30:03.711 --> 00:30:06.680
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

00:30:45.419 --> 00:30:47.182
Coming through!

00:31:17.818 --> 00:31:19.718
Aaah!

00:31:38.672 --> 00:31:40.105
Sight the muzzle flash!

00:31:40.174 --> 00:31:41.334
Aim for the flashes!

00:31:41.408 --> 00:31:43.273
I need a full strike,
fore and aft.

00:31:43.344 --> 00:31:45.904
Mr. Stephens, more cartridges!

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.939
Governor, barricade yourself
in my office.

00:31:51.252 --> 00:31:53.584
That's an order.

00:32:11.105 --> 00:32:12.436
Don't!

00:32:12.506 --> 00:32:14.269
Hello, chum.

00:32:18.212 --> 00:32:21.211
Up there.

00:32:29.723 --> 00:32:32.283
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you!

00:32:32.359 --> 00:32:33.053
What?

00:32:33.127 --> 00:32:35.095
You're the governor's daughter.

00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:36.629
In here!

00:32:37.965 --> 00:32:39.728
Listen.
They haven't seen you.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.234
The first chance you get,
run to the fort.

00:32:51.278 --> 00:32:52.267
Gotcha.

00:32:58.018 --> 00:33:00.316
No! No! No!
It's hot!

00:33:00.387 --> 00:33:01.479
You burned me!

00:33:01.555 --> 00:33:02.783
Come on!

00:33:35.289 --> 00:33:36.085
No!

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.036
We know you're here, poppet.

00:33:50.104 --> 00:33:51.196
Poppet.

00:33:51.271 --> 00:33:55.537
Come out and we promise
we won't hurt you.

00:33:55.609 --> 00:33:56.769
Eh?

00:33:58.445 --> 00:34:01.573
We will find you, poppet.

00:34:01.648 --> 00:34:06.984
You've got something of ours,
and it calls to us.

00:34:11.458 --> 00:34:15.224
The gold calls to us.

00:34:15.295 --> 00:34:17.661
Gold.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.231
Hello, poppet.

00:34:25.305 --> 00:34:27.296
Parley.

00:34:27.374 --> 00:34:27.999
What?

00:34:28.075 --> 00:34:29.235
Parley.

00:34:29.309 --> 00:34:31.402
I invoke the right of parley.

00:34:31.478 --> 00:34:34.747
According to the Code
of the Brethren
set down by the pirates Morgan
and Bartholomew,

00:34:34.815 --> 00:34:36.248
you have to take me
to your captain.

00:34:36.316 --> 00:34:37.908
I know the Code.

00:34:37.985 --> 00:34:39.543
If an adversary demands parley,

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.918
you can do them no harm
until the parley is complete.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.286
To blazes with the Code.

00:34:43.357 --> 00:34:46.326
She wants to be taken
to the captain.

00:34:47.094 --> 00:34:50.359
And she'll go without a fuss.

00:34:50.431 --> 00:34:53.457
We must honor the Code.

00:35:04.144 --> 00:35:06.078
Say goodbye.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.447
Goodbye.

00:35:15.189 --> 00:35:16.588
-Will!
-Come on!

00:35:16.657 --> 00:35:18.056
Elizabeth.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.859
Out of my way, scum!

00:35:40.914 --> 00:35:42.347
My sympathies, friend.

00:35:42.416 --> 00:35:44.646
You've no manner of luck at all.

00:36:06.406 --> 00:36:07.771
Come on, doggy.

00:36:07.841 --> 00:36:09.706
It's just you and me now.

00:36:09.776 --> 00:36:12.142
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

00:36:12.212 --> 00:36:13.941
Come on.
That's a boy.

00:36:14.014 --> 00:36:16.175
Good boy.
Come get the bone.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.842
That's a good boy.
Come on.

00:36:17.918 --> 00:36:20.148
A bit closer.
A bit closer.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.154
That's it.
That's it, doggy.

00:36:22.222 --> 00:36:25.714
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur.

00:36:27.594 --> 00:36:29.459
No, no!
I didn't mean it!

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:30.792
I didn't.

00:36:37.371 --> 00:36:39.362
This ain't the armory.

00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:44.673
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Twigg.

00:36:44.745 --> 00:36:47.236
Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:36:47.981 --> 00:36:50.142
Last time I saw you,

00:36:50.217 --> 00:36:54.813
you were all alone
on a godforsaken island,

00:36:54.888 --> 00:36:57.049
shrinking into the distance.

00:36:57.124 --> 00:36:59.649
His fortunes aren't
improved much.

00:36:59.726 --> 00:37:03.093
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

00:37:03.163 --> 00:37:08.267
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers
and mutineers.

00:37:11.772 --> 00:37:14.070
So there is a curse.

00:37:15.542 --> 00:37:16.600
That's interesting.

00:37:16.677 --> 00:37:19.441
You know nothing of hell.

00:37:27.621 --> 00:37:29.987
That's very interesting.

00:38:04.791 --> 00:38:07.624
I didn't know
we was taking on captives.

00:38:07.694 --> 00:38:10.857
She's invoked the right
of parley with Captain Barbossa.

00:38:10.931 --> 00:38:14.662
-I'm here to --
-You'll speak when spoken to.

00:38:15.736 --> 00:38:17.203
And ye will not lay a hand

00:38:17.271 --> 00:38:20.763
on those under the protection
of parley.

00:38:20.841 --> 00:38:22.570
Aye, sir.

00:38:24.945 --> 00:38:27.379
My apologies, miss.

00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:30.978
Captain Barbossa,
I am here to negotiate

00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:34.145
the cessation of hostilities
against Port Royal.

00:38:34.221 --> 00:38:36.451
There were a lot
of long words in there.

00:38:36.523 --> 00:38:39.617
We're naught but humble pirates.

00:38:39.693 --> 00:38:41.320
What is it that you want?

00:38:41.395 --> 00:38:43.625
I want you to leave
and never come back.

00:38:46.133 --> 00:38:49.500
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

00:38:51.004 --> 00:38:52.665
Means "no."

00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.770
Very well.

00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:59.711
I'll drop it.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.911
Me holds are bursting with swag.

00:39:05.986 --> 00:39:08.682
That bit of shine matters to us?

00:39:08.755 --> 00:39:10.450
Why?

00:39:10.524 --> 00:39:14.392
It's what you've been searching
for. I recognize this ship.

00:39:14.461 --> 00:39:17.521
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England.

00:39:17.597 --> 00:39:19.963
Did you, now?

00:39:21.702 --> 00:39:23.499
Fine.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.299
I suppose if it is worthless,

00:39:25.372 --> 00:39:27.465
there's no point
in me keeping it.

00:39:39.219 --> 00:39:41.653
You have a name, missy?

00:39:42.622 --> 00:39:45.614
Elizabeth Turner.

00:39:46.626 --> 00:39:49.026
I'm a maid
in the governor's household.

00:39:51.631 --> 00:39:53.826
Miss Turner.

00:39:55.635 --> 00:39:57.364
Bootstrap.

00:40:00.974 --> 00:40:03.602
How does a maid own
a trinket such as that?

00:40:03.677 --> 00:40:07.113
Family heirloom, perhaps?

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.115
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

00:40:10.183 --> 00:40:11.548
Very well.
Hand it over.

00:40:11.618 --> 00:40:15.645
We'll put your town to our
rudder and ne'er return.

00:40:28.769 --> 00:40:30.430
Our bargain?

00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:35.164
Still the guns and stow them.

00:40:36.376 --> 00:40:39.368
Wait!
You have to take me to shore!

00:40:39.446 --> 00:40:40.811
According to the Code --

00:40:40.881 --> 00:40:45.477
First, your return to shore
was not part of our agreement.

00:40:45.552 --> 00:40:46.814
So I must do nothing.

00:40:46.887 --> 00:40:49.822
You must be a pirate for
the Pirate's Code to apply,

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:50.822
and you're not.

00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:54.554
Thirdly, the Code is more
what you'd call guidelines

00:40:54.628 --> 00:40:56.289
than actual rules.

00:40:56.363 --> 00:41:00.129
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

00:41:20.754 --> 00:41:23.154
They've taken her.
They've taken Elizabeth.

00:41:23.223 --> 00:41:26.351
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

00:41:26.426 --> 00:41:28.951
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

00:41:29.029 --> 00:41:31.554
And where do you propose
we start?

00:41:31.631 --> 00:41:34.259
If you have information
concerning my daughter,

00:41:34.334 --> 00:41:36.268
please share it.

00:41:37.771 --> 00:41:41.935
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl,

00:41:42.008 --> 00:41:44.602
Mentioned it
is more what he did.

00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:48.537
Ask him where it is.
He could lead us to it.

00:41:48.615 --> 00:41:52.073
No. The pirates
who invaded this fort

00:41:52.152 --> 00:41:56.612
left Sparrow locked in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.591
We will establish
their most likely course.

00:41:59.659 --> 00:42:01.559
That's not good enough!

00:42:01.628 --> 00:42:05.462
Mr. Turner, you are not
a military man.

00:42:05.532 --> 00:42:07.193
You are not a sailor.

00:42:08.235 --> 00:42:09.566
You are a blacksmith.

00:42:09.636 --> 00:42:13.299
And this is not the moment
for rash actions.

00:42:14.875 --> 00:42:16.467
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

00:42:16.543 --> 00:42:20.104
you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:33.823
You. Sparrow.

00:42:33.894 --> 00:42:36.920
You are familiar with that ship.
The Black Pearl,

00:42:36.997 --> 00:42:37.929
I've heard of it.

00:42:37.998 --> 00:42:41.525
Where does it make berth?

00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:44.092
Have you not heard the stories?

00:42:45.539 --> 00:42:49.475
Captain Barbossa
and his crew of miscreants

00:42:49.543 --> 00:42:52.171
sail from the dreaded
lsla de Muerta.

00:42:52.245 --> 00:42:53.837
It's an island
that cannot be found,

00:42:53.914 --> 00:42:57.782
except by those
who already know where it is.

00:42:57.851 --> 00:43:00.285
The ship's real enough.

00:43:00.353 --> 00:43:02.287
It's anchorage
must be a real place.

00:43:02.355 --> 00:43:03.754
Where is it?

00:43:03.823 --> 00:43:05.882
Why ask me?

00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:07.426
Because you're a pirate.

00:43:07.494 --> 00:43:10.327
And you want to turn pirate
yourself, is that it?

00:43:11.431 --> 00:43:12.420
Never.

00:43:16.102 --> 00:43:17.330
They took Miss Swann.

00:43:17.404 --> 00:43:19.770
Oh, so it is
that you found a girl.

00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:22.967
I see. Well, if you're intending
to brave all,

00:43:23.043 --> 00:43:27.275
hasten to her rescue,
and so win fair lady's heart,

00:43:27.347 --> 00:43:29.611
you'll have to
do it alone, mate.

00:43:29.683 --> 00:43:32.117
I see no profit in it for me.

00:43:32.185 --> 00:43:33.652
I can get you out of here.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.915
How's that?
They key's run off.

00:43:35.989 --> 00:43:37.581
I helped build these cells.

00:43:37.657 --> 00:43:39.887
These are
half-pin barrel hinges.

00:43:41.294 --> 00:43:45.196
With the right leverage and the
proper application of strength.

00:43:45.632 --> 00:43:47.725
The door will lift free.

00:43:49.402 --> 00:43:51.427
What's your name?

00:43:51.504 --> 00:43:53.734
Will Turner.

00:43:53.807 --> 00:43:56.207
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

00:43:56.276 --> 00:43:58.369
Good, strong name.

00:43:58.445 --> 00:44:01.209
No doubt named for your father.

00:44:02.082 --> 00:44:03.174
Yes.

00:44:03.249 --> 00:44:05.843
Uh-huh.

00:44:05.919 --> 00:44:09.218
Well, Mr. Turner,
I've changed me mind.

00:44:09.289 --> 00:44:12.554
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear on pain of death

00:44:12.626 --> 00:44:14.594
I shall take you
to the Black Pearl

00:44:14.661 --> 00:44:16.754
and your bonny lass.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.196
Do we have an accord?

00:44:22.002 --> 00:44:22.661
Agreed.

00:44:22.736 --> 00:44:23.668
Agreed.

00:44:23.737 --> 00:44:25.364
Get me out.

00:44:28.441 --> 00:44:29.965
Hurry.
Someone will have heard that.

00:44:30.043 --> 00:44:32.273
Not without my effects.

00:44:38.785 --> 00:44:40.548
We're going to steal the ship?

00:44:42.389 --> 00:44:43.151
That ship?

00:44:43.223 --> 00:44:45.020
Commandeer.

00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:47.355
We're going to commandeer
that ship.

00:44:47.427 --> 00:44:49.361
Nautical term.

00:44:49.429 --> 00:44:51.329
One question
about your business.

00:44:51.398 --> 00:44:52.763
Or there's no use going.

00:44:52.832 --> 00:44:54.459
This girl.

00:44:54.534 --> 00:44:57.196
How far are you willing
to go to save her?

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.703
I'd die for her.

00:44:58.772 --> 00:45:00.034
Oh, good.

00:45:00.106 --> 00:45:01.903
No worries, then.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.327
This is either madness
or brilliance.

00:45:24.397 --> 00:45:29.061
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

00:45:57.497 --> 00:46:01.399
Everyone stay calm!
We are taking over the ship.

00:46:01.468 --> 00:46:03.459
Aye! Avast!

00:46:06.372 --> 00:46:09.466
This ship cannot be crewed
by two men.

00:46:09.542 --> 00:46:12.204
You'll never make it
out of the bay.

00:46:12.278 --> 00:46:16.942
Son, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:46:17.016 --> 00:46:18.574
Savvy?

00:46:22.122 --> 00:46:23.146
Commodore.

00:46:23.223 --> 00:46:26.124
Sir,
they've taken the Dauntless!

00:46:27.594 --> 00:46:29.323
Commodore!

00:46:29.395 --> 00:46:31.886
They've taken the ship!

00:46:31.965 --> 00:46:34.195
Sparrow and Turner
have taken the Dauntless!

00:46:34.267 --> 00:46:38.135
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

00:46:38.938 --> 00:46:43.773
That is without doubt the worst
pirate I have ever seen.

00:46:46.246 --> 00:46:47.770
Here they come.

00:46:52.418 --> 00:46:55.785
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

00:47:01.394 --> 00:47:05.262
Search every cabin, every hull,
down to the bilges.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.311
Sailors,
back to the Interceptor,

00:47:22.382 --> 00:47:23.440
Now!

00:47:29.522 --> 00:47:33.390
Thank you, Commodore, for
getting us ready to make way.

00:47:33.459 --> 00:47:36.758
We'd have had a hard time of it
by ourselves.

00:47:39.265 --> 00:47:41.631
Set topsails
and clear up this mess.

00:47:41.701 --> 00:47:43.635
With the wind,
we won't catch them.

00:47:43.703 --> 00:47:46.501
I don't need to. Get them
in range of the long nines.

00:47:46.573 --> 00:47:48.336
Hands, come about!

00:47:48.408 --> 00:47:50.569
Run out the guns!

00:47:50.643 --> 00:47:53.237
We are to fire
on our own ship, sir?

00:47:53.313 --> 00:47:55.304
I'd rather see her
at the bottom of the ocean

00:47:55.381 --> 00:47:57.372
than in the hands of a pirate.

00:47:58.418 --> 00:48:02.479
Commodore, he's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

00:48:05.491 --> 00:48:07.516
Abandon ship!

00:48:13.833 --> 00:48:17.428
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

00:48:17.503 --> 00:48:20.097
So it would seem.

00:48:28.646 --> 00:48:30.671
When I was a lad
living in England,

00:48:30.748 --> 00:48:32.682
my mother raised me by herself.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:37.380
After she died, I came out here,
looking for my father.

00:48:37.989 --> 00:48:39.957
Is that so?

00:48:40.959 --> 00:48:43.894
My father, Will Turner.

00:48:43.962 --> 00:48:46.954
It was only after you learnt
my name you agreed to help.

00:48:47.031 --> 00:48:49.397
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

00:48:49.467 --> 00:48:51.458
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

00:48:51.536 --> 00:48:53.561
You knew my father.

00:48:59.577 --> 00:49:00.839
I knew him.

00:49:00.912 --> 00:49:04.075
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

00:49:04.148 --> 00:49:07.242
Everyone else called him
Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.

00:49:07.318 --> 00:49:09.149
Bootstrap?

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.780
Good man.
Good pirate.

00:49:11.856 --> 00:49:13.949
I swear, you look just like him.

00:49:14.025 --> 00:49:15.049
It's not true.

00:49:15.126 --> 00:49:17.026
He was a merchant sailor.

00:49:17.095 --> 00:49:19.256
A respectable man
who obeyed the law.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.766
He was a bloody pirate.
A scallywag.

00:49:22.834 --> 00:49:26.702
My father was not a pirate.

00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:30.764
Put it away, son. It's not worth
you getting beat again.

00:49:30.842 --> 00:49:33.777
You ignored the rules
of engagement.

00:49:33.845 --> 00:49:35.335
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

00:49:35.413 --> 00:49:38.439
Then that's not much incentive
for me to fight fair.

00:49:45.556 --> 00:49:48.889
Now, as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.827
The only rules
that really matter are these.

00:49:51.896 --> 00:49:55.354
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

00:49:55.433 --> 00:49:56.798
For instance,

00:49:56.868 --> 00:50:00.360
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man

00:50:00.438 --> 00:50:01.598
or you can't.

00:50:01.673 --> 00:50:03.106
Pirate is in your blood,

00:50:03.174 --> 00:50:05.768
so you'll have to square
with that someday.

00:50:05.843 --> 00:50:07.003
Now, me, for example.

00:50:07.078 --> 00:50:08.978
I can let you drown.

00:50:09.047 --> 00:50:11.277
But I can't bring this ship
into Tortuga

00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:12.782
all by me onesy, savvy?

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:14.147
So.

00:50:19.023 --> 00:50:22.481
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

00:50:23.628 --> 00:50:25.528
Or can you not?

00:50:27.665 --> 00:50:29.565
Tortuga?

00:50:29.634 --> 00:50:31.033
Tortuga.

00:50:53.157 --> 00:50:55.682
More importantly,
it is indeed a sad life

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.729
that has never breathed deep
this sweet bouquet

00:50:58.796 --> 00:51:00.957
that is Tortuga, savvy?

00:51:02.033 --> 00:51:04.160
What do you think?

00:51:07.538 --> 00:51:08.596
lt'll linger.

00:51:08.673 --> 00:51:10.368
I'll tell you, mate,

00:51:10.441 --> 00:51:13.239
if every town in the world
were like this one,

00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:16.678
no man would ever feel unwanted.

00:51:16.748 --> 00:51:18.238
Scarlett!

00:51:20.318 --> 00:51:22.246
Not sure I deserved that.

00:51:23.287 --> 00:51:24.612
Giselle!

00:51:24.689 --> 00:51:25.621
Who was she?

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:26.554
What?

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.960
I may have deserved that.

00:51:32.463 --> 00:51:35.489
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

00:51:38.035 --> 00:51:39.935
Mother's love!

00:51:40.004 --> 00:51:41.904
Jack!

00:51:41.973 --> 00:51:45.204
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleeping.

00:51:45.276 --> 00:51:46.607
It's bad luck.

00:51:46.677 --> 00:51:48.975
Fortunately,
I know how to counter it.

00:51:49.046 --> 00:51:50.308
The man who did the waking

00:51:50.381 --> 00:51:52.645
buys the man who was sleeping
a drink.

00:51:52.717 --> 00:51:55.515
The man who was sleeping drinks
while listening to a proposition

00:51:55.586 --> 00:51:57.884
from the man who did the waking.

00:51:59.957 --> 00:52:02.619
Aye, that'll about do it.

00:52:06.764 --> 00:52:08.994
Blast!
I'm already awake!

00:52:09.066 --> 00:52:11.034
That was for the smell.

00:52:20.878 --> 00:52:22.812
Keep a sharp eye.

00:52:29.554 --> 00:52:33.780
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of yourn?

00:52:34.926 --> 00:52:37.121
I'm going after the Black Pearl,

00:52:40.965 --> 00:52:45.402
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.633
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

00:52:48.706 --> 00:52:52.039
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl,

00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:55.203
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

00:52:55.279 --> 00:52:57.679
All I need is a crew.

00:52:57.748 --> 00:52:59.272
From what I hear of Barbossa,

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:02.183
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one.

00:53:02.253 --> 00:53:04.721
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool.

00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:06.381
Prove me wrong.

00:53:06.457 --> 00:53:09.949
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

00:53:10.027 --> 00:53:12.860
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage.

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.207
The kid?

00:53:32.149 --> 00:53:36.176
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

00:53:36.254 --> 00:53:38.722
His only child, savvy?

00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:40.689
Is he, now?

00:53:43.628 --> 00:53:46.028
"Leverage," says you.

00:53:46.097 --> 00:53:49.032
"l think I feel a change
in the wind," says l.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.658
I'll find us a crew.

00:53:50.735 --> 00:53:53.499
There's bound to be some sailors
crazy as you.

00:53:53.571 --> 00:53:55.766
One can only hope.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:56.932
Take what you can.

00:53:57.008 --> 00:53:59.441
Give nothing back.

00:54:23.467 --> 00:54:25.367
You'll be dining
with the captain.

00:54:25.436 --> 00:54:28.564
And he requests you wear this.

00:54:28.639 --> 00:54:29.833
You tell the captain

00:54:29.907 --> 00:54:33.308
that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

00:54:33.377 --> 00:54:35.743
He said you'd say that.

00:54:35.813 --> 00:54:38.281
He also said,
if that be the case,

00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:40.180
you'll be dining with the crew.

00:54:40.251 --> 00:54:42.719
And you'll be naked.

00:54:48.392 --> 00:54:49.484
Fine.

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:10.743
There's no need to stand on
ceremony, nor call to impress.

00:55:10.815 --> 00:55:12.874
You must be hungry.

00:55:29.567 --> 00:55:31.467
Try the wine.

00:55:35.773 --> 00:55:36.831
And the apples.

00:55:36.907 --> 00:55:39.137
One of those next?

00:55:46.917 --> 00:55:48.612
It's poisoned.

00:55:50.254 --> 00:55:52.449
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

00:55:52.523 --> 00:55:54.115
Release me.
You have your trinket.

00:55:54.191 --> 00:55:56.716
I'm of no further value to you.

00:55:59.997 --> 00:56:03.558
You don't know what this is,
do you?

00:56:03.634 --> 00:56:05.295
It's a pirate medallion.

00:56:05.369 --> 00:56:08.805
This is Aztec gold.

00:56:08.873 --> 00:56:11.398
One of 882 identical pieces

00:56:11.475 --> 00:56:16.174
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortes himself.

00:56:16.247 --> 00:56:18.374
Blood money paid
to stem the slaughter

00:56:18.449 --> 00:56:21.077
he wreaked upon them
with his armies.

00:56:21.152 --> 00:56:24.485
But the greed of Cortes
was insatiable.

00:56:24.555 --> 00:56:32.223
So the heathen gods placed
upon the gold a terrible curse.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:34.722
Any mortal that removes

00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:38.200
but a single piece
from that stone chest

00:56:38.269 --> 00:56:41.670
shall be punished for eternity.

00:56:43.174 --> 00:56:46.575
I hardly believe in ghost
stories anymore, Captain.

00:56:46.644 --> 00:56:48.544
Aye.

00:56:48.612 --> 00:56:52.207
That's exactly what I thought
when we were told the tale.

00:56:52.283 --> 00:56:55.047
Buried on an island of dead
what cannot be found,

00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:57.815
except for those
who know where it is.

00:56:58.723 --> 00:57:00.520
Find it, we did.

00:57:01.726 --> 00:57:03.489
There be the chest.

00:57:03.561 --> 00:57:05.927
lnside be the gold.

00:57:05.996 --> 00:57:08.396
And we took them all.

00:57:08.466 --> 00:57:10.559
We spent them and traded them

00:57:10.634 --> 00:57:13.125
and frittered them away
on drink and food

00:57:13.204 --> 00:57:14.967
and pleasurable company.

00:57:15.039 --> 00:57:21.239
The more we gave them away,
the more we came to realize,

00:57:21.312 --> 00:57:24.406
the drink would not satisfy,

00:57:24.482 --> 00:57:28.009
food turned to ash
in our mouths,

00:57:28.085 --> 00:57:30.414
and all the pleasurable company
in the world

00:57:30.488 --> 00:57:32.979
could not slake our lust.

00:57:34.592 --> 00:57:37.993
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

00:57:38.963 --> 00:57:45.095
Compelled by greed, we were,
but now we are consumed by it.

00:57:56.247 --> 00:57:59.910
There is one way
we can end our curse.

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.283
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

00:58:06.357 --> 00:58:10.919
must be restored
and the blood repaid.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:17.331
Thanks to ye,
we have the final piece.

00:58:18.602 --> 00:58:20.866
And the blood to be repaid?

00:58:20.938 --> 00:58:26.001
That's why there's no sense
to be killin' you yet.

00:58:27.912 --> 00:58:29.539
Apple?

00:58:35.719 --> 00:58:36.777
Arr!

00:58:37.922 --> 00:58:39.549
No!

00:58:45.729 --> 00:58:46.787
I'm curious.

00:58:46.864 --> 00:58:50.391
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

00:58:56.273 --> 00:58:58.798
Aah!

00:59:48.325 --> 00:59:49.121
Aaaah!

00:59:54.198 --> 00:59:55.460
Look!

00:59:55.532 --> 00:59:59.093
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

00:59:59.169 --> 01:00:02.364
We are not among the living,
and so we cannot die.

01:00:02.439 --> 01:00:04.634
But neither are we dead.

01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:09.268
For too long I've been parched
and unable to quench it.

01:00:09.346 --> 01:00:14.206
Too long I've been starving
to death and haven't died.

01:00:14.285 --> 01:00:16.617
I feel nothing.

01:00:16.687 --> 01:00:20.453
Not the wind on my face
nor the spray of the sea

01:00:20.524 --> 01:00:24.119
nor the warmth
of a woman's flesh.

01:00:24.895 --> 01:00:28.661
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

01:00:28.732 --> 01:00:30.461
You're in one!

01:00:48.852 --> 01:00:53.756
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.930
Feast your eyes, Captain.

01:01:01.999 --> 01:01:04.559
All of them faithful hands
before the mast.

01:01:04.635 --> 01:01:07.968
Every man worth his salt.

01:01:08.038 --> 01:01:10.029
And crazy to boot.

01:01:10.107 --> 01:01:13.565
So this is
your able-bodied crew?

01:01:19.149 --> 01:01:21.276
-You, sailor!
-Cotton, sir.

01:01:21.352 --> 01:01:25.049
Mr. Cotton, do you have
the courage to follow orders

01:01:25.122 --> 01:01:28.114
and stay true in the face
of danger and death?

01:01:28.192 --> 01:01:31.457
Mr. Cotton!
Answer, man!

01:01:31.528 --> 01:01:34.156
He's a mute. Poor devil
had his tongue cut out.

01:01:34.231 --> 01:01:36.495
He trained the parrot
to talk for him.

01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:39.001
No one's yet figured how.

01:01:41.638 --> 01:01:44.471
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:45.803
Same question.

01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:49.277
Wind in the sails!
Wind in the sails!

01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:52.079
Mostly we figure
that means "yes."

01:01:52.149 --> 01:01:53.343
Of course it does.

01:01:53.417 --> 01:01:55.282
Satisfied?

01:01:55.352 --> 01:01:57.513
Well, you've proved they're mad.

01:01:57.588 --> 01:02:00.079
And what's the benefit for us?

01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:11.664
Anamaria.

01:02:13.437 --> 01:02:15.234
I suppose
you didn't deserve that.

01:02:15.305 --> 01:02:17.239
No, that one I deserved.

01:02:17.307 --> 01:02:19.502
You stole my boat!

01:02:19.576 --> 01:02:22.238
Actually --

01:02:22.312 --> 01:02:25.110
Borrowed.
Borrowed without permission.

01:02:25.182 --> 01:02:27.207
But with every intention
of bringing it back.

01:02:27.284 --> 01:02:28.774
But you didn't!

01:02:28.852 --> 01:02:31.719
You'll get another one.

01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:32.619
I will.

01:02:32.689 --> 01:02:34.179
A better one.

01:02:34.258 --> 01:02:35.919
A better one!

01:02:35.993 --> 01:02:36.789
That one.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.487
What one?

01:02:40.464 --> 01:02:42.227
That one?

01:02:45.035 --> 01:02:46.798
Aye, that one.

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:48.462
-What say you?
-Aye!

01:02:48.539 --> 01:02:49.938
Aye!

01:02:50.007 --> 01:02:51.804
Anchors aweigh!

01:02:51.875 --> 01:02:56.175
No, no, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

01:02:56.246 --> 01:02:58.476
lt'll be far worse
not to have her.

01:03:32.149 --> 01:03:35.744
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find

01:03:35.819 --> 01:03:37.753
with a compass
that doesn't work?

01:03:37.821 --> 01:03:39.914
Aye, the compass
doesn't point North,

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:43.551
but we're not trying
to find North, are we?

01:03:53.437 --> 01:03:55.871
We should drop canvas, sir.

01:03:55.939 --> 01:03:58.772
She can hold a bit longer.

01:04:00.177 --> 01:04:03.806
What's in your head that's
put you in such a fine mood?

01:04:03.881 --> 01:04:05.849
We're catching up.

01:04:20.531 --> 01:04:22.863
Time to go, poppet.

01:04:22.933 --> 01:04:26.300
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

01:05:18.217 --> 01:05:23.519
Dead men tell no tales.

01:05:25.258 --> 01:05:26.657
Puts a chill in the bones

01:05:26.726 --> 01:05:30.662
how many honest sailors have
been claimed by this passage.

01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:47.678
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

01:05:47.747 --> 01:05:50.841
Not a lot's known about Jack
fore he showed up in Tortuga

01:05:50.917 --> 01:05:53.784
with a mind to go after the
treasure of the lsla de Muerta.

01:05:53.853 --> 01:05:55.115
That was before I'd met him.

01:05:55.188 --> 01:05:58.180
Back when he was Captain
of the Black Pearl,

01:05:58.257 --> 01:05:59.246
What?

01:06:02.729 --> 01:06:04.390
He failed to mention that.

01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:06.694
He plays things
closer to the vest now.

01:06:06.766 --> 01:06:08.825
And a hard-learned lesson
it was.

01:06:08.901 --> 01:06:11.369
Three days out,
the first mate comes to him

01:06:11.437 --> 01:06:13.496
and says everything's
an equal share.

01:06:13.573 --> 01:06:16.041
That should mean the location
of the treasure.

01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:18.407
Jack gives up the bearings.

01:06:18.478 --> 01:06:21.641
That night, there was a mutiny.

01:06:21.714 --> 01:06:24.842
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die,

01:06:24.917 --> 01:06:28.011
but not before he'd gone mad
with the heat.

01:06:31.357 --> 01:06:33.791
So that's the reason
for all the...

01:06:35.895 --> 01:06:38.329
Reason's got nothing
to do with it.

01:06:38.397 --> 01:06:40.661
Now, Will,
when a pirate's marooned,

01:06:40.733 --> 01:06:43.793
he's a given a pistol with
a single shot. One shot.

01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:46.998
Well, that won't do much good
hunting or to be rescued.

01:06:47.073 --> 01:06:50.509
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

01:06:50.576 --> 01:06:53.670
that pistol will start
to look real friendly.

01:06:53.746 --> 01:06:57.341
But Jack escaped the island, and
he still has that single shot.

01:06:57.416 --> 01:07:00.852
Oh, he won't use it,
though, save on one man.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.047
His mutinous first mate.

01:07:03.122 --> 01:07:05.454
-Barbossa.
-Aye.

01:07:06.292 --> 01:07:08.021
How did Jack get off the island?

01:07:08.094 --> 01:07:09.618
Well, I'll tell ye.

01:07:09.695 --> 01:07:11.492
He waded out into the shallows.

01:07:11.564 --> 01:07:14.032
He waited there
three days and three nights

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.931
till all manner of sea creatures

01:07:16.002 --> 01:07:18.766
'came acclimated
to his presence.

01:07:18.838 --> 01:07:20.567
And on the fourth morning,

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.767
he roped
a couple of sea turtles,

01:07:22.842 --> 01:07:26.073
lashed them together,
and made a raft.

01:07:27.079 --> 01:07:28.842
He roped a couple
of sea turtles?

01:07:28.915 --> 01:07:31.577
Aye, sea turtles.

01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:35.053
What did he use for rope?

01:07:40.326 --> 01:07:42.521
Human hair.

01:07:42.595 --> 01:07:44.392
From my back.

01:07:45.398 --> 01:07:46.558
Let go the anchor!

01:07:46.632 --> 01:07:49.066
Aye, Captain, aye!

01:07:49.135 --> 01:07:52.102
Young Mr. Turner and l
are to go ashore.

01:07:52.171 --> 01:07:55.800
Captain, what if the worst
should happen?

01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:57.001
Keep to the Code.

01:07:57.076 --> 01:07:59.169
Aye, the Code.

01:08:24.303 --> 01:08:25.497
Move.

01:08:25.571 --> 01:08:27.869
10 years of hoarding swag.

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:30.431
And now we finally
get to spend it.

01:08:36.949 --> 01:08:40.851
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:44.617
You can buy an eye what actually
fits and is made of glass.

01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:47.659
This one does splinter
something terrible.

01:08:48.494 --> 01:08:50.655
Stop rubbing it.

01:09:09.172 --> 01:09:12.164
What Code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

01:09:12.242 --> 01:09:14.369
Pirate's Code.

01:09:14.444 --> 01:09:19.074
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:22.684
No heroes amongst thieves?

01:09:23.353 --> 01:09:25.821
For having such
a bleak outlook on pirates,

01:09:25.889 --> 01:09:28.756
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

01:09:28.825 --> 01:09:31.760
Sprung a man from jail,

01:09:31.828 --> 01:09:34.194
commandeered a ship
of the fleet,

01:09:34.264 --> 01:09:37.597
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga.

01:09:39.302 --> 01:09:42.669
And you're completely
obsessed with treasure.

01:09:45.408 --> 01:09:49.777
That's not true.
I am not obsessed with treasure.

01:09:56.253 --> 01:09:59.017
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

01:09:59.089 --> 01:10:01.887
Gentlemen, the time has come!.

01:10:01.958 --> 01:10:04.950
Our salvation is nigh!

01:10:05.829 --> 01:10:07.888
Our torment is near an end.

01:10:07.964 --> 01:10:09.556
Elizabeth.

01:10:09.633 --> 01:10:12.227
For 10 years
we've been tested and tried,

01:10:12.302 --> 01:10:14.099
and each man jack of you here

01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:17.537
has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

01:10:17.607 --> 01:10:20.269
and a hundred times again!

01:10:21.778 --> 01:10:24.076
Suffered, I have!

01:10:24.147 --> 01:10:27.480
Punished, we were,
the lot of us.

01:10:27.551 --> 01:10:31.647
Disproportionate to our crime!

01:10:32.856 --> 01:10:34.824
Here it is!

01:10:37.761 --> 01:10:41.390
The cursed treasure
of Cortes himself.

01:10:43.066 --> 01:10:47.730
Every last piece that went
astray, we have returned.

01:10:47.804 --> 01:10:49.465
Save for this.

01:10:49.539 --> 01:10:50.972
Jack!

01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:54.841
Not yet. We wait
for the opportune moment.

01:10:54.911 --> 01:10:59.075
881 we found, but despaired
of ever finding the last.

01:10:59.149 --> 01:11:00.946
When's that?

01:11:01.017 --> 01:11:03.542
When it's
of greatest profit to you?

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:06.350
May I ask you something?

01:11:06.423 --> 01:11:10.052
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

01:11:10.126 --> 01:11:11.457
Do us a favor.

01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:15.487
I know it's difficult for you,
but please stay here

01:11:15.565 --> 01:11:18.557
and try not to do
anything stupid.

01:11:21.104 --> 01:11:25.231
And who among us has paid
the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

01:11:25.308 --> 01:11:25.967
Us!

01:11:26.042 --> 01:11:28.875
And whose blood
must yet be paid?

01:11:28.945 --> 01:11:30.606
Hers!

01:11:32.916 --> 01:11:35.146
You know the first thing
I'm gonna do

01:11:35.218 --> 01:11:38.085
after the curse is lifted?

01:11:39.656 --> 01:11:43.183
Eat a whole bushel of apples.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.893
Begun by blood.

01:11:52.969 --> 01:11:55.699
By blood undone.

01:11:59.376 --> 01:12:03.073
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not gonna be your leverage.

01:12:12.389 --> 01:12:14.619
That's it?

01:12:14.691 --> 01:12:16.215
Waste not.

01:12:54.297 --> 01:12:55.525
Did it work?

01:12:56.366 --> 01:12:59.199
-I don't feel no different.
-How do we tell?

01:13:05.542 --> 01:13:08.238
You're not dead.

01:13:08.311 --> 01:13:09.778
No.

01:13:11.081 --> 01:13:12.048
He shot me!

01:13:12.115 --> 01:13:13.605
It didn't work.

01:13:13.683 --> 01:13:16.345
The curse it still upon us!

01:13:20.356 --> 01:13:23.189
You, maid!
Your father, what was his name?

01:13:23.259 --> 01:13:26.057
Was your father William Turner?

01:13:26.129 --> 01:13:27.096
No.

01:13:27.163 --> 01:13:30.758
Where's his child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

01:13:30.834 --> 01:13:34.429
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

01:13:41.511 --> 01:13:43.536
You two!

01:13:43.613 --> 01:13:46.946
You brought us the wrong person!

01:13:47.016 --> 01:13:48.313
No!

01:13:48.384 --> 01:13:51.182
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

01:13:51.254 --> 01:13:53.722
She said her name was Turner.

01:13:55.759 --> 01:13:57.624
I think she lied to us.

01:13:59.829 --> 01:14:02.627
You brought us here for nothing.

01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:06.328
I won't take questioning or
second guesses from you, Twigg.

01:14:06.402 --> 01:14:07.630
Who's to blame?

01:14:07.704 --> 01:14:11.367
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse.

01:14:12.375 --> 01:14:15.435
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

01:14:15.512 --> 01:14:17.605
Yeah!

01:14:19.349 --> 01:14:22.648
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:27.816
If any coward here dare
challenge me, let him speak!

01:14:28.591 --> 01:14:32.357
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood,

01:14:32.428 --> 01:14:33.292
just in case.

01:14:33.363 --> 01:14:34.853
Yeah!

01:14:43.439 --> 01:14:44.667
The medallion!

01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:46.072
She's taken it!

01:14:46.142 --> 01:14:50.579
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

01:14:54.584 --> 01:14:56.279
No oars here!

01:14:56.352 --> 01:14:58.718
Where's the oars?

01:14:58.788 --> 01:15:00.983
The oars have gone missing.

01:15:01.057 --> 01:15:02.752
Find them!

01:15:06.496 --> 01:15:08.657
Find the oars!

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.863
You.

01:15:14.037 --> 01:15:15.868
You're supposed to be dead!

01:15:15.939 --> 01:15:17.736
Am I not?

01:15:27.183 --> 01:15:29.879
Palulay.

01:15:29.953 --> 01:15:32.353
Palu-li-la-la-lulu.

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:36.588
Parlili.

01:15:36.659 --> 01:15:41.722
Parsnip, parsley,
partner, partner.

01:15:41.798 --> 01:15:42.560
Parley?

01:15:42.632 --> 01:15:44.964
That's the one!
Parley!

01:15:45.034 --> 01:15:46.194
Parley!

01:15:46.269 --> 01:15:48.635
Parley?

01:15:48.705 --> 01:15:53.642
Damn to the depths whatever man
that thought up "parley"!

01:15:54.477 --> 01:15:56.342
That would be the French.

01:16:08.024 --> 01:16:09.548
Not more pirates.

01:16:09.626 --> 01:16:11.992
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

01:16:12.595 --> 01:16:14.290
Mr. Gibbs?

01:16:14.364 --> 01:16:16.662
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

01:16:16.733 --> 01:16:18.166
Jack?

01:16:18.234 --> 01:16:20.794
Jack Sparrow?

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:22.895
He fell behind.

01:16:29.712 --> 01:16:31.270
Keep to the Code.

01:16:32.649 --> 01:16:33.946
Weigh anchor!

01:16:34.017 --> 01:16:37.145
Hoist the sails!
Make quick!

01:16:43.159 --> 01:16:47.061
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:51.131
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.363
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

01:16:55.405 --> 01:16:58.397
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

01:16:58.474 --> 01:17:03.173
Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

01:17:03.246 --> 01:17:06.272
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:17:06.349 --> 01:17:08.681
Aye.

01:17:08.751 --> 01:17:09.877
Kill him.

01:17:11.554 --> 01:17:14.523
The girl's blood
didn't work, did it?

01:17:16.225 --> 01:17:18.352
Hold your fire!

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.431
You know whose blood we need.

01:17:28.471 --> 01:17:31.235
I know whose blood you need.

01:17:37.447 --> 01:17:40.280
What sort of a man trades
a man's life for a ship?

01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:41.510
Pirate.

01:17:42.518 --> 01:17:45.544
Here. Let me.

01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:47.282
Thank you.

01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:51.958
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

01:17:53.262 --> 01:17:54.024
Why?

01:17:57.266 --> 01:17:58.665
I don't know.

01:18:00.503 --> 01:18:03.438
I'm sorry. Blacksmith's hands.
I know they're rough.

01:18:03.506 --> 01:18:07.499
No.
I mean yes, they are, but...

01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:12.881
But don't stop.

01:18:20.223 --> 01:18:21.884
Elizabeth.

01:18:37.607 --> 01:18:39.336
It's yours.

01:18:43.246 --> 01:18:46.738
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

01:18:46.816 --> 01:18:49.250
It was a gift from my father.

01:18:49.318 --> 01:18:51.149
He sent it to me.

01:18:55.525 --> 01:18:57.618
Why did you take it?

01:18:59.629 --> 01:19:03.224
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

01:19:04.067 --> 01:19:05.932
That would have been awful.

01:19:09.272 --> 01:19:11.866
It wasn't your blood
they needed.

01:19:14.744 --> 01:19:16.644
It was my father's blood.

01:19:18.481 --> 01:19:20.108
My blood.

01:19:26.022 --> 01:19:27.512
The blood of a pirate.

01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:30.184
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

01:19:43.106 --> 01:19:45.131
You expect to leave me
on some beach

01:19:45.208 --> 01:19:48.439
with nothing but a name and
your word it's the one I need

01:19:48.511 --> 01:19:52.174
and watch you sail away
in my ship?

01:19:52.248 --> 01:19:53.237
No.

01:19:53.316 --> 01:19:55.784
I expect to leave you
standing on some beach

01:19:55.852 --> 01:19:57.615
with absolutely no name at all,

01:19:57.687 --> 01:20:00.247
watching me sail away
on my ship,

01:20:00.323 --> 01:20:02.723
and then I'll shout the name
back to you.

01:20:02.792 --> 01:20:04.123
Savvy?

01:20:04.193 --> 01:20:06.855
That still leaves the problem
of me on some beach

01:20:06.929 --> 01:20:09.261
with naught but a name
and your word

01:20:09.332 --> 01:20:11.823
it's the one I need.

01:20:11.901 --> 01:20:13.698
Of the two of us,

01:20:13.769 --> 01:20:17.398
I'm the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

01:20:17.473 --> 01:20:21.466
Therefore, my word is the one
we'll be trusting.

01:20:21.544 --> 01:20:25.981
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

01:20:26.048 --> 01:20:29.142
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

01:20:29.218 --> 01:20:32.881
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

01:20:33.923 --> 01:20:35.823
Funny old world, isn't it?

01:20:39.095 --> 01:20:41.586
Captain, we're coming up
on the Interceptor,

01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:57.304
I'm having a thought here,
Barbossa.

01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:59.314
What say we run up
a flag of truce,

01:20:59.382 --> 01:21:01.213
I scurry over
to the Interceptor,

01:21:01.284 --> 01:21:05.050
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

01:21:05.121 --> 01:21:09.116
Now, that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl,

01:21:09.192 --> 01:21:13.026
People are easy to search
when they're dead.

01:21:13.095 --> 01:21:14.892
Lock him in the brig.

01:21:27.176 --> 01:21:29.201
Hands aloft to loose t'gallants!

01:21:29.278 --> 01:21:32.475
With this wind, she'll carry
every sail we've got!

01:21:32.548 --> 01:21:33.572
What's happening?

01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:37.050
The Black Pearl,
She's gaining on us.

01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:43.090
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

01:21:43.159 --> 01:21:46.219
You can tell them that
after they've caught us.

01:21:46.295 --> 01:21:48.092
We're shallower on the draft?

01:21:48.164 --> 01:21:48.994
Aye.

01:21:49.065 --> 01:21:52.000
Well, then can't we lose them
amongst those shoals?

01:21:53.135 --> 01:21:55.831
We don't have to outrun them
long, just long enough.

01:21:55.905 --> 01:21:58.430
Lighten the ship, stem to stern!

01:21:58.507 --> 01:22:02.238
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost.

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:13.120
Apparently, there's a leak.

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:31.237
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

01:22:31.307 --> 01:22:34.208
And run out the sweeps.

01:22:34.277 --> 01:22:36.040
-Pull!
-Ho!

01:23:01.337 --> 01:23:03.498
We're gonna need that.

01:23:11.414 --> 01:23:12.972
It was a good plan.

01:23:13.049 --> 01:23:14.573
Up till now.

01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:15.912
Gibbs!

01:23:15.985 --> 01:23:17.816
We have to make a stand.

01:23:17.887 --> 01:23:19.821
We must fight!

01:23:19.889 --> 01:23:21.049
Load the guns!

01:23:21.123 --> 01:23:22.215
With what?

01:23:22.291 --> 01:23:24.191
Anything. Everything!

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.285
Anything we have left.

01:23:27.663 --> 01:23:29.597
Load the guns!

01:23:29.665 --> 01:23:31.326
Case shot and langrage!

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.766
Nails and crushed glass!

01:23:35.604 --> 01:23:37.504
With a will!

01:23:58.094 --> 01:24:00.824
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

01:24:00.896 --> 01:24:03.626
She'll rake us without
ever presenting a target.

01:24:03.699 --> 01:24:05.690
Lower the anchor
on the right side.

01:24:06.335 --> 01:24:08.462
On the starboard side!

01:24:08.537 --> 01:24:10.300
It has the element of surprise.

01:24:10.373 --> 01:24:12.898
You're daft, lady!
You both are!

01:24:12.975 --> 01:24:14.909
Daft like Jack!

01:24:14.977 --> 01:24:17.207
Lower the starboard anchor!

01:24:17.279 --> 01:24:21.238
Do it, you dogs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

01:24:39.235 --> 01:24:41.203
Let go!

01:24:47.009 --> 01:24:49.273
They're clubhauling!

01:24:49.345 --> 01:24:51.609
Hard to port!
Rack the starboard oars.

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.910
Hard to port!

01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:07.658
Keep us steady, man.

01:25:13.102 --> 01:25:14.160
Now!

01:25:14.236 --> 01:25:15.260
Fire!

01:25:15.337 --> 01:25:17.498
Fire all!

01:25:26.048 --> 01:25:28.983
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

01:26:14.497 --> 01:26:17.057
We could use
a few more ideas, lass.

01:26:17.132 --> 01:26:18.190
Your turn.

01:26:18.267 --> 01:26:20.531
We need us a devil's dowry.

01:26:20.603 --> 01:26:22.833
We'll give them her.

01:26:22.905 --> 01:26:25.135
She's not what they're after.

01:26:27.009 --> 01:26:28.340
The medallion.

01:26:49.598 --> 01:26:53.034
Raise your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

01:26:53.102 --> 01:26:55.832
Hands, grapnels, at the ready.

01:26:55.905 --> 01:26:58.237
Prepare to board!

01:27:32.041 --> 01:27:34.407
Blast all to carcasses, men!

01:27:34.476 --> 01:27:36.671
Forward clear
to the powder magazine.

01:27:36.745 --> 01:27:41.876
And the rest of you,
bring me that medallion!

01:27:49.892 --> 01:27:51.189
Help!

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:53.251
Hey!

01:28:10.145 --> 01:28:11.806
Below!

01:28:31.233 --> 01:28:33.064
Thanks very much.

01:28:45.748 --> 01:28:47.215
Jack!

01:28:48.083 --> 01:28:49.846
Bloody empty.

01:28:53.722 --> 01:28:55.053
Aaah!

01:29:05.567 --> 01:29:07.797
That's not very nice.

01:29:12.307 --> 01:29:13.501
Where's the medallion?

01:29:13.575 --> 01:29:15.372
Wretch!

01:29:16.311 --> 01:29:17.710
Ahh.

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:19.748
Where's dear William?

01:29:21.016 --> 01:29:22.483
Will!

01:29:24.319 --> 01:29:25.411
Will!

01:29:25.487 --> 01:29:26.920
Elizabeth!

01:29:30.159 --> 01:29:31.922
Monkey!

01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:39.531
I can't move it!

01:29:39.601 --> 01:29:40.568
Come on!

01:29:40.636 --> 01:29:41.864
Will!

01:29:41.937 --> 01:29:43.063
Elizabeth!

01:29:55.384 --> 01:29:57.443
Why, thank you, Jack.

01:29:57.519 --> 01:29:59.146
You're welcome.

01:29:59.221 --> 01:30:02.918
Not you.
We named the monkey "Jack."

01:30:02.991 --> 01:30:07.394
Gents, our hope is restored!

01:30:42.631 --> 01:30:45.964
Any of you so much as thinks
the word "parley,"

01:30:46.034 --> 01:30:49.492
I'll have your guts for garters.

01:30:56.478 --> 01:30:58.070
Will!

01:30:58.147 --> 01:31:00.741
You've got to stop it!

01:31:00.816 --> 01:31:03.011
-Stop it!
-Welcome back, miss.

01:31:03.085 --> 01:31:05.815
You took advantage
of our hospitality last time.

01:31:05.888 --> 01:31:09.551
It holds fair now
you return the favor.

01:31:14.997 --> 01:31:16.225
Barbossa!

01:31:18.267 --> 01:31:20.064
Will.

01:31:21.970 --> 01:31:24.165
She goes free.

01:31:24.239 --> 01:31:26.571
What's in your head, boy?

01:31:27.242 --> 01:31:28.504
She goes free!

01:31:28.577 --> 01:31:32.343
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

01:31:32.414 --> 01:31:34.314
Don't do anything stupid.

01:31:37.386 --> 01:31:39.013
You can't.

01:31:39.087 --> 01:31:40.746
I can.

01:31:41.757 --> 01:31:43.349
Like that.

01:31:44.359 --> 01:31:46.224
Who are you?

01:31:46.295 --> 01:31:47.819
No one.
He's no one.

01:31:47.896 --> 01:31:51.354
A distant cousin of
my aunt's nephew twice removed.

01:31:51.433 --> 01:31:53.526
Lovely singing voice, though.
Eunuch.

01:31:53.602 --> 01:31:55.229
My name is Will Turner.

01:31:55.304 --> 01:31:58.034
My father was
Bootstrap Bill Turner.

01:31:58.106 --> 01:32:00.700
His blood runs in my veins.

01:32:00.776 --> 01:32:03.540
He's the spitting image
of old Bootstrap Bill

01:32:03.612 --> 01:32:04.943
come back to haunt us.

01:32:05.013 --> 01:32:08.915
On my word, do as I say,
or I'll pull this trigger

01:32:08.984 --> 01:32:12.181
and be lost
to Davy Jones' locker.

01:32:12.254 --> 01:32:14.552
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

01:32:14.623 --> 01:32:15.749
Elizabeth goes free.

01:32:15.824 --> 01:32:18.520
Yes, we know that one.
Anything else?

01:32:21.363 --> 01:32:24.890
And the crew.
The crew are not to be harmed.

01:32:29.404 --> 01:32:31.031
Agreed.

01:32:37.312 --> 01:32:38.802
Go on, poppet, go!

01:32:38.881 --> 01:32:40.439
Walk the plank!

01:32:50.425 --> 01:32:54.122
Barbossa, you lying bastard!
You swore she'd go free!

01:32:54.196 --> 01:32:56.960
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.

01:32:57.032 --> 01:32:58.590
I agreed she'd go free,

01:32:58.667 --> 01:33:02.535
but it was you who failed
to specify when or where.

01:33:07.943 --> 01:33:11.640
Though does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it?

01:33:11.713 --> 01:33:13.237
Aye.

01:33:13.315 --> 01:33:16.682
So I'll be having that dress
back before you go.

01:33:20.889 --> 01:33:22.083
I always liked you.

01:33:26.228 --> 01:33:27.991
Goes with your black heart.

01:33:29.498 --> 01:33:31.932
Ooh, it's still warm.

01:33:34.536 --> 01:33:36.094
Off you go!

01:33:36.705 --> 01:33:38.536
Come on!

01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:43.234
Too long!

01:33:54.022 --> 01:33:56.991
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

01:33:57.926 --> 01:34:01.293
Jack...

01:34:02.364 --> 01:34:03.831
Did you not notice?

01:34:03.899 --> 01:34:08.862
That be the same island
we made you governor of
on our last little trip.

01:34:09.871 --> 01:34:11.133
I did notice.

01:34:11.206 --> 01:34:12.639
Perhaps you'll be
able to conjure up

01:34:12.708 --> 01:34:15.336
another miraculous escape.

01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:17.139
But I doubt it.

01:34:19.881 --> 01:34:21.439
Off you go.

01:34:21.516 --> 01:34:22.380
Yeah.

01:34:22.451 --> 01:34:25.045
Last time, you left me
a pistol with one shot.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.145
By the powers, you're right.

01:34:27.222 --> 01:34:30.714
Where be Jack's pistol?
Bring it forward.

01:34:33.862 --> 01:34:37.263
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman would give us

01:34:37.332 --> 01:34:38.594
a pair of pistols.

01:34:38.667 --> 01:34:40.362
lt'll be one pistol as before,

01:34:40.435 --> 01:34:42.869
You can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady

01:34:42.938 --> 01:34:45.873
and starve to death yourself.

01:35:09.228 --> 01:35:10.320
That's the second time

01:35:10.396 --> 01:35:13.854
I've had to watch that man
sail away with my ship.

01:35:15.601 --> 01:35:18.195
But you were marooned
on this island before.

01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:19.862
We can escape
the same way you did.

01:35:19.938 --> 01:35:22.805
To what point and purpose,
young missy?

01:35:22.875 --> 01:35:24.775
The Black Pearl is gone.

01:35:24.843 --> 01:35:28.404
Unless you have a rudder and
sails hidden in that bodice.

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.675
Unlikely.

01:35:30.749 --> 01:35:34.276
Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

01:35:36.588 --> 01:35:38.579
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

01:35:38.657 --> 01:35:42.559
You vanished from seven agents
of the East lndia Company.

01:35:42.628 --> 01:35:45.654
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot.

01:35:45.731 --> 01:35:48.791
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:52.637
How did you escape last time?

01:35:59.344 --> 01:36:03.781
Last time, I was here a grand
total of three days, all right?

01:36:04.983 --> 01:36:06.507
Last time...

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.989
The rumrunners
used this island as a cache,

01:36:11.056 --> 01:36:14.025
came by, and I was able to
barter passage off.

01:36:14.093 --> 01:36:15.424
From the looks of things,

01:36:15.494 --> 01:36:17.826
they've long been out
of business.

01:36:17.896 --> 01:36:22.390
Probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

01:36:23.001 --> 01:36:25.765
So that's it, then?

01:36:25.838 --> 01:36:27.897
That's the secret
grand adventure

01:36:27.973 --> 01:36:30.498
of the infamous Jack Sparrow?

01:36:30.576 --> 01:36:35.570
You spent three days lying
on a beach, drinking rum?

01:36:37.749 --> 01:36:40.115
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

01:36:49.061 --> 01:36:50.653
We're devils,
we're black sheep

01:36:50.729 --> 01:36:52.253
We're really bad eggs

01:36:52.331 --> 01:36:54.595
Drink up,
me hearties, yo ho

01:36:54.666 --> 01:36:56.531
Yo ho, yo ho

01:36:56.602 --> 01:36:57.534
Ouch!

01:36:57.603 --> 01:36:58.968
A pirate's life for me

01:36:59.037 --> 01:37:01.028
I love this song!

01:37:04.042 --> 01:37:07.068
Really bad eggs!

01:37:07.146 --> 01:37:08.135
Ooh.

01:37:11.083 --> 01:37:12.948
When I get the Pearl back,

01:37:13.018 --> 01:37:15.680
I'm gonna teach it
to the whole crew.

01:37:15.754 --> 01:37:17.312
We'll sing it all the time.

01:37:17.389 --> 01:37:21.257
You'll be the most fearsome
pirate in the Spanish Main.

01:37:21.326 --> 01:37:24.124
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

01:37:24.196 --> 01:37:25.754
The entire ocean.

01:37:25.831 --> 01:37:28.493
The entire world.

01:37:28.567 --> 01:37:32.162
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is, you know.

01:37:32.237 --> 01:37:35.070
It's not just a keel
and a deck and sails.

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:36.630
That's what a ship needs.

01:37:36.708 --> 01:37:44.410
But what a ship is,
what the Black Pearl really is,

01:37:44.483 --> 01:37:46.246
is freedom.

01:37:48.587 --> 01:37:52.717
Jack, it must be
really terrible for you

01:37:52.791 --> 01:37:55.259
to be trapped on this island.

01:37:55.327 --> 01:37:56.658
Oh, yes.

01:37:56.728 --> 01:38:01.097
But the company is infinitely
better than last time,

01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:02.394
I think.

01:38:04.102 --> 01:38:06.332
The scenery
has definitely improved.

01:38:06.405 --> 01:38:07.895
-Mr. Sparrow.
-Mm-hmm?

01:38:07.973 --> 01:38:10.498
I'm not entirely sure
I've had enough rum

01:38:10.576 --> 01:38:12.737
to allow that kind of talk.

01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:16.273
I know exactly
what you mean, love.

01:38:22.955 --> 01:38:24.513
To freedom.

01:38:27.125 --> 01:38:29.218
To the Black Pearl,

01:38:58.523 --> 01:39:00.889
No! Not good!

01:39:00.959 --> 01:39:03.553
Stop! Not good!

01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:04.755
What are you doing?

01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:07.424
You burned all the food,
the shade! The rum!

01:39:07.499 --> 01:39:09.160
Yes, the rum is gone.

01:39:09.234 --> 01:39:10.963
Why is the rum gone?

01:39:11.036 --> 01:39:12.799
One, because it is a vile drink

01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:15.704
that turns even the most
respectable men into scoundrels.

01:39:15.774 --> 01:39:18.868
Two, that signal is over
a thousand feet high.

01:39:18.944 --> 01:39:21.174
The entire Royal Navy
is looking for me.

01:39:21.246 --> 01:39:24.875
Do you think there is the
slightest chance they won't see?

01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:26.781
But why is the rum gone?

01:39:27.753 --> 01:39:29.778
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

01:39:29.855 --> 01:39:32.619
You give it one hour, maybe two,
and you will see

01:39:32.691 --> 01:39:35.091
white sails on that horizon.

01:39:41.933 --> 01:39:45.835
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

01:39:45.904 --> 01:39:48.304
Well, it bloody is now!

01:39:55.213 --> 01:39:57.807
There'll be no living
with her after this.

01:39:58.517 --> 01:40:00.485
-But we've got to save Will.
-No.

01:40:00.552 --> 01:40:02.313
You're safe now.

01:40:02.387 --> 01:40:04.082
We will return to Port Royal,

01:40:04.156 --> 01:40:06.124
not go gallivanting
after pirates!

01:40:06.191 --> 01:40:08.159
Then we condemn him to death.

01:40:09.361 --> 01:40:12.159
The boy's fate is regrettable,

01:40:12.230 --> 01:40:14.755
but so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

01:40:14.833 --> 01:40:18.530
To rescue me. To prevent
anything from happening to me.

01:40:18.603 --> 01:40:22.095
If I may be so bold as to inject
my professional opinion.

01:40:22.174 --> 01:40:25.166
The Pearl was listing near
to scuppers after the battle.

01:40:25.243 --> 01:40:28.178
It's very unlikely she'll
be able to make good time.

01:40:28.246 --> 01:40:30.077
Think about it.

01:40:30.148 --> 01:40:32.082
The Black Pearl,

01:40:32.150 --> 01:40:36.416
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

01:40:36.488 --> 01:40:38.956
How can you pass that up, right?

01:40:40.592 --> 01:40:43.390
By remembering that I serve
others, Mr. Sparrow.

01:40:43.462 --> 01:40:44.793
Not only myself.

01:40:44.863 --> 01:40:47.093
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this.

01:40:47.165 --> 01:40:48.598
For me.

01:40:48.667 --> 01:40:50.965
As a wedding gift.

01:40:51.036 --> 01:40:53.163
Elizabeth.

01:40:53.238 --> 01:40:56.503
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

01:40:58.543 --> 01:40:59.737
I am.

01:40:59.811 --> 01:41:01.642
A wedding!
I love weddings!

01:41:01.713 --> 01:41:03.613
Drinks all around!

01:41:05.851 --> 01:41:06.977
I know.

01:41:07.052 --> 01:41:09.384
"Clap him in irons," right?

01:41:11.223 --> 01:41:15.421
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

01:41:15.494 --> 01:41:18.657
and provide us with a bearing
to lsla de Muerta.

01:41:18.730 --> 01:41:20.322
You will spend the rest
of the voyage

01:41:20.399 --> 01:41:22.833
contemplating all meanings
of the phrase

01:41:22.901 --> 01:41:25.096
"silent as the grave."

01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:26.728
Do I make myself clear?

01:41:26.805 --> 01:41:29.399
lnescapably clear.

01:41:32.911 --> 01:41:36.108
Shiver me timbers.

01:41:36.181 --> 01:41:38.240
Cotton here says
you missed a bit.

01:41:42.621 --> 01:41:44.646
You knew William Turner?

01:41:45.724 --> 01:41:48.215
Ol' Bootstrap Bill.

01:41:48.293 --> 01:41:50.090
We knew him.

01:41:50.162 --> 01:41:54.121
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow.

01:41:54.199 --> 01:41:56.724
The mutiny and all.

01:41:56.802 --> 01:41:59.635
He said it wasn't right
with the Code.

01:41:59.704 --> 01:42:03.663
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you.

01:42:04.476 --> 01:42:08.139
He said we deserved
to be cursed.

01:42:08.213 --> 01:42:10.272
And remain cursed.

01:42:10.348 --> 01:42:11.372
Stupid blighter.

01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:13.281
Good man.

01:42:13.852 --> 01:42:15.945
Well, as you can imagine,

01:42:16.021 --> 01:42:18.854
that didn't sit too well
with the captain.

01:42:18.924 --> 01:42:22.155
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all.

01:42:22.227 --> 01:42:26.357
-Tell him what Barbossa did.
-I'm telling the story!

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:32.068
So, what the captain did.

01:42:32.137 --> 01:42:36.430
He strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

01:42:36.508 --> 01:42:39.568
And last we saw
of Ol' Bill Turner,

01:42:39.644 --> 01:42:45.014
he was sinking to
the crushing, black oblivion
of Davy Jones' locker.

01:42:45.951 --> 01:42:47.646
'Course it was only after that

01:42:47.719 --> 01:42:50.654
we learned we needed his blood
to lift the curse.

01:42:50.722 --> 01:42:53.122
That's what you call ironic.

01:42:58.029 --> 01:42:59.326
Bring him.

01:43:05.936 --> 01:43:08.063
I don't care for the situation.

01:43:08.138 --> 01:43:11.699
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn to an ambush.

01:43:11.775 --> 01:43:15.108
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

01:43:15.179 --> 01:43:19.309
I convince Barbossa to send his
men out with their little boats.

01:43:19.383 --> 01:43:21.613
You and your mates return
to the Dauntless

01:43:21.685 --> 01:43:25.052
and blast the bejesus out of
them with your little cannons.

01:43:25.122 --> 01:43:27.352
What do you have to lose?

01:43:27.424 --> 01:43:30.689
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

01:43:31.528 --> 01:43:34.156
Now, to be quite honest
with you,

01:43:34.231 --> 01:43:36.165
there's a risk to those
aboard the Dauntless,

01:43:36.233 --> 01:43:39.725
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

01:43:39.803 --> 01:43:41.964
Sorry, but it's
for your own safety.

01:43:42.039 --> 01:43:44.405
The commodore ordered!
I have to tell him!

01:43:44.475 --> 01:43:45.703
The pirates!

01:43:45.776 --> 01:43:47.676
They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

01:43:47.745 --> 01:43:49.906
Don't worry.
He's informed of that.

01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:54.144
A mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story.

01:43:54.218 --> 01:43:56.948
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

01:44:07.631 --> 01:44:08.996
No reason to fret.

01:44:09.066 --> 01:44:12.035
Just a prick of the finger.
A few drops of blood.

01:44:12.102 --> 01:44:13.729
No mistakes this time.

01:44:13.804 --> 01:44:17.797
He's only half Turner.
We spill it all!

01:44:19.610 --> 01:44:21.475
Guess there is reason to fret.

01:44:35.359 --> 01:44:37.418
Beg your pardon.
Beg your pardon.

01:44:37.494 --> 01:44:39.325
-Begun by blood.
-Excuse me.

01:44:39.396 --> 01:44:42.160
By blood --

01:44:44.802 --> 01:44:46.235
Jack!

01:44:46.503 --> 01:44:47.629
It's not possible.

01:44:47.705 --> 01:44:49.832
Not probable.

01:44:50.441 --> 01:44:52.909
Where's Elizabeth?

01:44:52.977 --> 01:44:55.468
She's safe,
just like I promised.

01:44:55.546 --> 01:44:58.310
She's set to marry Norrington,
like she promised.

01:44:58.382 --> 01:45:00.714
You get to die for her,
like you promised.

01:45:00.784 --> 01:45:03.446
So we're all
men of our word, really.

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.318
Except for Elizabeth who is,
in fact, a woman.

01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:08.824
Shut up!
You're next.

01:45:10.828 --> 01:45:14.025
You don't want to
be doing that, mate.

01:45:14.098 --> 01:45:16.828
No, I really think I do.

01:45:17.835 --> 01:45:19.860
Your funeral.

01:45:23.073 --> 01:45:25.541
Why don't I want to be doing it?

01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:27.440
Well, because...

01:45:27.511 --> 01:45:32.608
Because the HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

01:45:32.683 --> 01:45:37.848
is floating just offshore,
waiting for you.

01:45:45.863 --> 01:45:47.262
What we doing here?

01:45:48.799 --> 01:45:52.826
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

01:45:52.903 --> 01:45:58.500
We catch them in a crossfire,
send them down to see Old Hob.

01:45:58.575 --> 01:46:00.270
I know why we're here.

01:46:00.344 --> 01:46:02.005
I meant, why aren't we doing

01:46:02.079 --> 01:46:05.947
what Mr. Sparrow said we should
do with the cannons and all?

01:46:06.016 --> 01:46:09.645
Because it was
Mr. Sparrow who said it.

01:46:12.289 --> 01:46:14.814
You think he wasn't
telling the truth?

01:46:14.892 --> 01:46:17.087
Just hear me out, mate.

01:46:17.161 --> 01:46:19.322
You order your men
to row to the Dauntless,

01:46:19.396 --> 01:46:21.523
They do what they do best.

01:46:21.598 --> 01:46:23.589
Robert's your uncle.
Fannie's your aunt.

01:46:23.667 --> 01:46:26.363
There you are with two ships.

01:46:26.437 --> 01:46:28.632
The makings of
your very own fleet.

01:46:28.705 --> 01:46:32.300
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship, and who's to argue?

01:46:32.376 --> 01:46:34.344
But what of the Pearl?

01:46:35.479 --> 01:46:37.242
Name me captain.

01:46:37.314 --> 01:46:40.249
I'll sail under your colors.
I'll give you 10% of me plunder.

01:46:40.317 --> 01:46:46.085
And you get to introduce
yourself as Commodore Barbossa.

01:46:46.156 --> 01:46:47.088
Savvy?

01:46:47.157 --> 01:46:50.786
I suppose in exchange, you
want me not to kill the whelp.

01:46:50.861 --> 01:46:53.955
No, no, no. Not at all.
By all means, kill the whelp.

01:46:54.031 --> 01:46:56.329
Just not yet.

01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:02.066
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

01:47:04.241 --> 01:47:06.801
For instance...

01:47:08.112 --> 01:47:11.548
After you've killed
Norrington's men.

01:47:11.615 --> 01:47:16.484
Every last one.

01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:28.655
You've been planning this
from the beginning.

01:47:28.732 --> 01:47:30.723
Ever since you learned my name.

01:47:30.801 --> 01:47:31.893
Yeah.

01:47:34.204 --> 01:47:35.967
I want 50% of your plunder.

01:47:36.039 --> 01:47:37.472
-15%.
-40%.

01:47:37.541 --> 01:47:39.566
25%.

01:47:39.643 --> 01:47:40.974
I'll buy you the hat.

01:47:41.044 --> 01:47:44.980
A really big one, Commodore.

01:47:47.818 --> 01:47:50.685
We have an accord.

01:47:50.754 --> 01:47:53.314
All hands to the boats!

01:47:54.291 --> 01:47:55.417
Apologies.

01:47:55.492 --> 01:47:57.187
You give the orders.

01:47:58.362 --> 01:48:02.526
Gents, take a walk.

01:48:07.104 --> 01:48:09.004
Not to the boats?

01:49:07.197 --> 01:49:09.188
Hold fire.

01:49:12.236 --> 01:49:16.434
Oh, this is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy.

01:49:16.506 --> 01:49:20.340
Except they was in a horse
instead of dresses.

01:49:20.410 --> 01:49:21.809
Wooden horse.

01:49:34.658 --> 01:49:36.319
A moment, please.

01:49:39.896 --> 01:49:41.295
Elizabeth?

01:49:44.134 --> 01:49:46.898
I just want you to know

01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:49.962
I believe you made
a very good decision today.

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:52.167
Couldn't be more proud of you.

01:49:53.176 --> 01:49:55.371
But, you know,
even a good decision,

01:49:55.445 --> 01:49:59.404
if made for the wrong reasons,
can be a wrong decision.

01:50:05.922 --> 01:50:07.583
Look into that.
Report back.

01:50:07.658 --> 01:50:08.886
Lieutenant?

01:50:15.599 --> 01:50:18.067
Yoo-hoo!

01:50:27.878 --> 01:50:29.277
Elizabeth?

01:50:31.114 --> 01:50:32.604
Are you there?

01:50:34.685 --> 01:50:37.313
Elizabeth, are you
even listening to me?

01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:06.515
Oh, what have you done?

01:51:06.583 --> 01:51:08.278
-Oooh!
-Stop that!

01:51:08.352 --> 01:51:10.980
Already feel like a fool.

01:51:11.054 --> 01:51:12.783
Look nice, though.

01:51:16.927 --> 01:51:19.157
I look nice?

01:51:55.298 --> 01:51:58.665
I must admit, Jack,
I thought I had you figured.

01:51:58.735 --> 01:52:01.795
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

01:52:01.872 --> 01:52:03.806
Me?
I'm dishonest.

01:52:03.874 --> 01:52:07.105
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

01:52:07.177 --> 01:52:08.371
Honestly.

01:52:08.445 --> 01:52:10.913
It's the honest ones
you want to watch for,

01:52:10.981 --> 01:52:13.279
because you can never predict

01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:17.514
when they're going to do
something incredibly stupid.

01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:44.877
Aaah!

01:52:50.654 --> 01:52:53.020
You're off the edge
of the map, mate.

01:52:53.089 --> 01:52:56.058
Here there be monsters.

01:52:59.963 --> 01:53:00.163
Right!

01:53:00.163 --> 01:53:02.825
Right!

01:53:02.899 --> 01:53:04.867
What would you pick
to eat first?

01:53:04.935 --> 01:53:06.994
I think we should decide now.

01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:10.039
Just so we're ready
when the time comes.

01:53:34.464 --> 01:53:36.159
What was that?

01:53:54.384 --> 01:53:55.476
Shh!

01:53:58.488 --> 01:54:00.183
Miss Elizabeth!

01:54:19.576 --> 01:54:22.477
Make for the ship!
Move!

01:54:31.187 --> 01:54:32.984
To the ship!

01:54:35.792 --> 01:54:37.760
Row, men!

01:55:15.231 --> 01:55:18.029
You can't beat me, Jack.

01:55:41.391 --> 01:55:43.621
That's interesting.

01:55:53.737 --> 01:55:55.705
I couldn't resist, mate.

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.717
Aaah!

01:57:02.105 --> 01:57:03.265
Sorry!

01:57:12.348 --> 01:57:13.872
So what now, Jack Sparrow?

01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:16.714
Are we to be two immortals
locked in an epic battle

01:57:16.786 --> 01:57:20.244
until judgment day
and trumpets sound?

01:57:20.323 --> 01:57:22.415
Or you could surrender.

01:57:30.567 --> 01:57:33.468
Aaaah!

01:57:48.818 --> 01:57:50.183
All of you with me!

01:57:50.253 --> 01:57:52.312
Will is in that cave.
We must save him.

01:57:52.388 --> 01:57:55.619
Ready.
And heave!

01:58:01.131 --> 01:58:03.656
Please, I need your help!
Come on!

01:58:03.733 --> 01:58:06.224
Any port in a storm.

01:58:06.302 --> 01:58:08.827
Cotton's right.
We've got the Pearl,

01:58:08.905 --> 01:58:10.964
What about Jack?
Are you gonna leave him?

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.871
Jack owes us a ship.

01:58:12.942 --> 01:58:14.967
There's the Code to consider.

01:58:15.044 --> 01:58:16.375
The Code?

01:58:17.914 --> 01:58:19.347
You're pirates.

01:58:19.415 --> 01:58:22.111
Hang the Code,
and hang the rules!

01:58:22.185 --> 01:58:25.348
They're more like
guidelines anyway.

01:58:27.957 --> 01:58:30.551
Bloody pirates!

01:58:40.036 --> 01:58:41.970
-Hey.
-What?

01:58:42.038 --> 01:58:44.006
Is it supposed to be doing that?

01:58:44.073 --> 01:58:46.906
They're stealing our ship!

01:58:46.976 --> 01:58:49.308
Bloody pirates!

01:58:50.647 --> 01:58:53.207
Boarders, away!

01:59:00.757 --> 01:59:02.987
Come on!

01:59:03.059 --> 01:59:04.458
Gaaah!

01:59:28.651 --> 01:59:29.811
Me eye!

01:59:40.196 --> 01:59:42.096
-Aaaah!
-Aaaah!

01:59:49.873 --> 01:59:52.000
I'm gonna teach you
the meaning of pain!

01:59:52.075 --> 01:59:53.633
Do you like pain?

01:59:55.345 --> 01:59:57.575
Try wearing a corset.

02:00:07.223 --> 02:00:09.521
Whose side is Jack on?

02:00:09.592 --> 02:00:11.059
At the moment?

02:00:25.475 --> 02:00:27.443
Aaaaaah!

02:00:46.896 --> 02:00:48.022
No fair.

02:01:11.721 --> 02:01:17.216
Ten years you carry that pistol,
and now you waste your shot.

02:01:17.293 --> 02:01:19.124
He didn't waste it.

02:01:44.954 --> 02:01:46.751
I feel...

02:01:50.994 --> 02:01:52.461
Cold.

02:02:54.557 --> 02:02:56.081
Parley?

02:02:57.126 --> 02:02:59.060
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

02:02:59.128 --> 02:03:00.459
Huzzah!

02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:01.462
Huzzah!

02:03:47.276 --> 02:03:49.608
We should return
to the Dauntless,

02:03:52.115 --> 02:03:55.209
Your fianc will be wanting
to know you're safe.

02:04:05.461 --> 02:04:08.453
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

02:04:09.565 --> 02:04:11.055
That was it.

02:04:12.635 --> 02:04:13.761
If you'd be so kind,

02:04:13.836 --> 02:04:17.067
I'd be much obliged if you'd
drop me off at my ship.

02:04:22.111 --> 02:04:24.375
I'm sorry, Jack.

02:04:26.315 --> 02:04:31.116
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

02:04:45.935 --> 02:04:48.995
"Jack Sparrow,
be it known that you..."

02:04:49.071 --> 02:04:51.505
Captain.
Captain Jack Sparrow.

02:04:51.574 --> 02:04:56.170
"For your willful commission
of crimes against the crown."

02:04:56.479 --> 02:04:59.107
"Said crimes being numerous
in quantity

02:04:59.182 --> 02:05:01.548
and sinister in nature.

02:05:01.617 --> 02:05:05.348
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith.

02:05:05.421 --> 02:05:07.912
Piracy, smuggling..."

02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:10.288
This is wrong.

02:05:10.359 --> 02:05:13.123
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law.

02:05:13.196 --> 02:05:15.721
As are we all.

02:05:15.798 --> 02:05:18.460
"lmpersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy.

02:05:18.534 --> 02:05:21.628
lmpersonating a cleric
of the church of England."

02:05:21.704 --> 02:05:22.864
Ah, yeah.

02:05:22.939 --> 02:05:26.636
"Sailing under false colors,
arson, kidnapping,

02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:33.740
looting, poaching, brigandage,
pilfering, depravity,

02:05:33.816 --> 02:05:37.718
depredation,
and general lawlessness.

02:05:37.787 --> 02:05:40.119
And for these crimes

02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:42.749
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

02:05:42.825 --> 02:05:46.522
hung by the neck until dead.

02:05:46.596 --> 02:05:48.962
May God have mercy
on your soul."

02:05:49.031 --> 02:05:51.397
Governor Swann.

02:05:51.467 --> 02:05:53.196
Commodore.

02:05:54.103 --> 02:05:55.695
Elizabeth.

02:05:56.472 --> 02:05:59.964
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you.

02:06:02.411 --> 02:06:03.571
I love you.

02:06:20.529 --> 02:06:21.587
Marines.

02:06:21.664 --> 02:06:23.393
I can't breathe.

02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:26.261
Elizabeth!

02:06:28.571 --> 02:06:29.629
Move!

02:06:41.450 --> 02:06:42.712
What...

02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:55.622
Move!

02:07:14.617 --> 02:07:16.050
Come on!

02:07:16.118 --> 02:07:18.245
-Right!
-Come on, lads!

02:07:43.346 --> 02:07:48.215
I thought we might endure some
ill-conceived escape attempt.

02:07:48.284 --> 02:07:49.751
But not from you.

02:07:49.819 --> 02:07:53.619
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

02:07:53.689 --> 02:07:55.350
And this is how you thank me?

02:07:55.424 --> 02:07:58.120
By throwing in
your lot with him?

02:07:58.194 --> 02:07:59.126
He's a pirate!

02:07:59.195 --> 02:08:01.186
And a good man.

02:08:02.498 --> 02:08:04.398
If all I have achieved
is the hangman

02:08:04.467 --> 02:08:08.130
will earn two pairs of boots
instead of one, so be it.

02:08:08.204 --> 02:08:09.967
My conscience will be clear.

02:08:10.039 --> 02:08:13.805
You forget your place, Turner.

02:08:14.710 --> 02:08:18.441
It's right here
between you and Jack.

02:08:22.485 --> 02:08:23.474
As is mine.

02:08:23.552 --> 02:08:24.883
Elizabeth!

02:08:26.255 --> 02:08:28.519
Lower your weapons.

02:08:28.591 --> 02:08:31.025
For goodness sake,
put them down!

02:08:35.431 --> 02:08:39.026
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then?

02:08:39.902 --> 02:08:41.460
It is.

02:08:49.979 --> 02:08:53.745
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

02:08:53.816 --> 02:08:56.341
I think we've all arrived
at a special place.

02:08:56.419 --> 02:08:57.477
Spiritually.

02:08:57.553 --> 02:08:59.646
Ecumenically.

02:08:59.722 --> 02:09:01.747
Grammatically.

02:09:02.425 --> 02:09:06.088
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

02:09:06.162 --> 02:09:07.527
Know that.

02:09:11.467 --> 02:09:12.764
Elizabeth.

02:09:14.737 --> 02:09:18.036
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

02:09:19.375 --> 02:09:20.672
I'm sorry.

02:09:22.978 --> 02:09:23.774
Will.

02:09:26.282 --> 02:09:27.715
Nice hat.

02:09:29.185 --> 02:09:31.278
Friends.

02:09:33.422 --> 02:09:36.516
This is a day that you will
always remember

02:09:36.592 --> 02:09:37.957
as the day that...

02:09:43.432 --> 02:09:47.027
ldiot. He has nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

02:09:48.204 --> 02:09:50.536
Sail ho!

02:09:58.113 --> 02:10:00.741
What's your plan of action?

02:10:01.383 --> 02:10:02.680
Sir?

02:10:06.956 --> 02:10:09.220
Perhaps on the rare occasion

02:10:09.291 --> 02:10:13.318
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

02:10:13.395 --> 02:10:17.422
piracy itself
can be the right course?

02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:23.404
Mr. Turner.

02:10:28.777 --> 02:10:31.575
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

02:10:37.486 --> 02:10:39.613
This is a beautiful sword.

02:10:41.757 --> 02:10:45.249
I would expect the man who
made it to show the same care

02:10:45.327 --> 02:10:48.262
in every aspect of his life.

02:10:50.266 --> 02:10:52.029
Thank you.

02:10:54.670 --> 02:10:56.604
Commodore!

02:10:56.672 --> 02:10:58.435
What about Sparrow?

02:10:59.608 --> 02:11:03.305
Well, I think we can afford to
give him one day's head start.

02:11:09.051 --> 02:11:09.881
So.

02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:14.915
This is the path
you've chosen, is it?

02:11:16.258 --> 02:11:21.161
After all, he is a blacksmith.

02:11:21.230 --> 02:11:22.595
No.

02:11:27.336 --> 02:11:29.395
He's a pirate.

02:11:54.296 --> 02:11:56.025
Heave!

02:12:05.874 --> 02:12:08.809
Thought you were supposed to
keep to the Code.

02:12:08.877 --> 02:12:13.007
We figured they were
more actual guidelines.

02:12:17.119 --> 02:12:18.882
Thank you.

02:12:19.888 --> 02:12:21.788
Captain Sparrow.

02:12:25.594 --> 02:12:27.789
The Black Pearl is yours.

02:12:42.978 --> 02:12:44.707
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:46.509
Hands to braces!

02:12:46.582 --> 02:12:49.050
Let down and haul to run free!

02:12:50.419 --> 02:12:54.719
Now, bring me that horizon.

02:13:01.263 --> 02:13:04.130
And really bad eggs.

02:13:07.002 --> 02:13:09.232
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho!

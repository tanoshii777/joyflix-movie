00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:09.152
Guarantine zone slow down

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.388
What's this?

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.099
Gonna bury them hogs again?

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.685
It's not foot-and-mouth disease.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:45.606
There was a minor leak
in the biotech district.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:49.234
- It's nothing.
- You said that before!

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:53.572
If you bury my livestock again,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.908
I'll really go mad!

00:01:57.326 --> 00:02:00.704
Don't you worry, and go right ahead.

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:04.374
Go on.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.049
"Tiny leak", my hairy ass.

00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:15.886
They're so full of shit.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.116
What the...

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.753
Such a shit day.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:43.432
Train to Busan

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.517
Sir,

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:49.813
if we pull out now, the market will suffer.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.276
This could be based on a false report...

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.614
Yes, right away.

00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:00.616
Pardon?

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:05.996
No, not at all. I'm still a novice.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.708
Okay. I'll see you on the field.

00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:12.586
Yes, take care.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.729
Send Kim in.

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:38.987
Mysterious fish deaths at Jinyang reservoir

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.580
what should we do?

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.124
Sell all related funds.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.585
- Everything?
- Yeah.

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.380
There will be serious repercussions.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:05:00.133
Market stability and
individual traders will...

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.469
- Kim.
- Sir?

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.889
Do you work for the lemmings?

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:09.726
Sell everything. Right away.

00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:12.062
Yes, sir.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.358
One minute.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.072
What are kids into these days?

00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:31.123
Let's not waste time suing each other.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.168
I don't care what you do with your time.

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:35.294
I'm raising Su-an.

00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:38.130
How are you raising her?

00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:40.591
Do you even talk to her?

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.595
She wants to come here tomorrow by herself!

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:45.846
Did you know that?

00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:48.098
Stop this bullshit!

00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:50.893
You call yourself a father?

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.895
A child can't go alone.

00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:56.523
Then bring her here. She wants to come.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.358
Not tomorrow.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.903
You know it's her birthday tomorrow, right?

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:02.905
Of course!

00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:33.101
- Did you eat?
- Kind of.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.811
Where's Su-an?

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:39.107
She's in her room.

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:43.195
I can ride the train by myself.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:47.407
You can come pick me up at the station!

00:06:51.787 --> 00:06:53.121
Mommy, I'm hanging up.

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:08.720
It's okay, you can talk to her.

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.430
I hung up.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:16.186
You told her you wanted to go to Busan?

00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:21.024
Sweetie, I have so much work lately.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.486
I'll have more time next week.

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.822
Could you wait till then?

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.456
Here.

00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:43.797
What. Thought I forgot? Happy birthday.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.176
Go on, open it.

00:08:04.276 --> 00:08:07.196
What, you don't like it?

00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:23.504
Children's day this year.

00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:32.262
Is there anything else you want?

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:37.392
Busan. I want to see mommy.

00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:38.936
Tomorrow.

00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:43.148
I told you, another time, okay?

00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:45.651
No, tomorrow.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:50.030
You always say next time, and lie to me.

00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:55.911
I won't waste your time. I can go alone.

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:05.295
Are you busy nowadays?

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.548
You know how it is.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:12.177
So you'll take her to busan tomorrow?

00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:15.639
- Yes.
- That's good.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:19.601
While you're down there...

00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:26.817
Have a heart-to-heart talk with your wife.

00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:31.572
A marriage shouldn't be
abandoned so easily.

00:09:33.532 --> 00:09:35.367
For Su-an's sake, too.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:38.579
Mom, I'll take care of it.

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.834
It's a crucial period right now.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:50.549
Sure. You know best.

00:09:52.134 --> 00:09:58.015
She was disappointed
that you weren't at the recital.

00:09:58.974 --> 00:10:03.061
It's a crucial period for her, too.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:33.008
Proudly swept the rain by the cliffs

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:41.225
as it glided through the trees

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.144
still...

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.563
It's fine.

00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:49.107
Baby, it's okay.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.610
Su-an, go on.

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:09.711
Yeah, mom.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.463
Yeah.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:14.675
No, with dad.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:18.053
Okay, bye.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.889
See you soon. Bye.

00:11:35.988 --> 00:11:39.616
I saw you sing at the school recital.

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:43.203
When did you see it? You weren't there.

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:49.001
I may look like I'm not there,
but I'm always watching you.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:53.255
You didn't finish, right?

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.132
Right.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.303
Why was that? You should've finished it.

00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:04.558
Whatever you do, you must
finish what you start...

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.102
It's worse than not doing it at...

00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:20.449
Jesus...

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.830
What's going on this early?

00:12:34.338 --> 00:12:36.381
Are you okay?

00:12:37.633 --> 00:12:39.676
That startled me.

00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:53.315
Looks like something's happening.

00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:08.831
Attention, please.

00:13:08.956 --> 00:13:14.878
KTX 101 bound for busan
is departing shortly.

00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:19.508
- Where is car 4?
- Car 4 is that way.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.134
Thank you.

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:23.262
Attention, please.

00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:29.184
KTX 101 bound for busan
is departing shortly.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.788
Hye-young, hey!

00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:51.623
Your scarf.

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:52.708
Adjust it, please.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:02.009
Everyone be quiet and sit down!

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.510
Okay!

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:07.723
Look, it's Jin-Hee!

00:14:10.309 --> 00:14:12.352
Hey, what are you doing here?

00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:14.605
I'm your cheerleader.

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.398
- Are you serious?
- Didn't you hear?

00:14:16.607 --> 00:14:18.567
That's awesome. You got your wish.

00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:21.528
- Sit with me.
- Do your best!

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.364
Hey, Jin-Hee.

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.410
What're you listening to?

00:14:30.746 --> 00:14:33.165
Go sit somewhere else.

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:34.750
It's not even on.

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:40.380
If I tell you I like you,
just say "thank you."

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:41.590
It's your fate.

00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:44.593
That's right! It's fate!

00:14:44.927 --> 00:14:48.514
Accept her! Accept her!

00:14:48.597 --> 00:14:51.058
Accept her!

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.064
Jong-Gil, here.

00:14:57.356 --> 00:14:59.608
When did you boil this?

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.236
We'll arrive in an hour, what's the point?

00:15:02.319 --> 00:15:03.319
Don't want it.

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.239
- Take it.
- No way.

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:08.784
Mr. Suh, are you on the train?

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:10.369
Yes, what is it?

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.579
We've been getting a lot of calls.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.249
There was a strike at
Ansan industrial park.

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.376
What?

00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:22.881
Prep a situation report for me.

00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:24.591
I'll be back before lunch.

00:15:24.633 --> 00:15:25.634
Yes, sir.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.825
I'm sorry... I am...

00:16:31.867 --> 00:16:34.953
I'm sorry...

00:16:35.496 --> 00:16:37.122
I'm so sorry...

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.791
I'm really sorry.

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.720
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:54.389
Good morning.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.642
I think someone... odd... got on board.

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:57.809
Where?

00:16:57.935 --> 00:17:00.312
He's in the washroom.

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:03.273
I don't know what he's doing.

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:05.400
It's been a while.

00:17:05.484 --> 00:17:09.446
Our apologies. We'll check right away.

00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:21.208
Excuse me?

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:24.545
Hello?

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.508
Sir?

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:39.393
All dead... everyone...

00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:40.978
Sir?

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.355
Excuse me?

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:45.899
May I check your ticket?

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:48.193
All dead...

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:51.154
Sir, if you do not have a ticket,

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:54.616
you'll be escorted off at the next station.

00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:57.286
Everyone's dead!

00:17:59.288 --> 00:18:00.288
Pardon?

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.375
All dead...

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.798
Hey, kiddo.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.885
If you don't study, you'll end up like him.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:17.681
Mom said whoever says that is a bad person.

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:21.727
She must've flunked school.

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:26.648
Sir, please come out.
We'll move to the back.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.560
Urgent?

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.439
Two people are pissing,
so it'll take a bit.

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:10.025
There. Use that washroom.

00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:11.192
Go on.

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:16.073
This'll take a bit.

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:19.368
Honey, how's it going in there?

00:19:20.786 --> 00:19:23.789
Sorry. I'm sorry. No worries.

00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:24.998
Take your time.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.708
Go over there.

00:19:28.544 --> 00:19:30.838
Take it easy, she's gone.

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:32.297
Relax.

00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:43.267
Miss, are you okay?

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:44.434
Miss!

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.978
Oh god...

00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:49.898
A passenger requiring medical
attention in car 11.

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:51.358
Chief?

00:20:04.997 --> 00:20:06.456
- Hello?
- Yes, Kim?

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:09.042
It's more serious than we anticipated.

00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:11.295
It's not just an overnight Ansan incident.

00:20:12.004 --> 00:20:15.674
I don't know what's happening,
but it's not a simple strike.

00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:16.008
Military deployed to control riots

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.051
they say it's nationwide.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.761
- Is it airborne?
- Hello?

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:22.639
- Is she breathing?
- Yes, she is.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.558
But the seizures are uncontrollable!

00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:27.227
Sir, what should we do?

00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:29.396
I'll call you back.

00:20:37.738 --> 00:20:39.573
Indiscriminate violence at riot

00:20:39.615 --> 00:20:41.950
oh no, they'll get hurt.

00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:43.702
That's terrible.

00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:46.955
People nowadays will riot over anything.

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:49.791
In the old days, they'd be re-educated.

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:51.752
You mustn't say that.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.713
Look, look.

00:20:54.922 --> 00:20:57.674
What's up with them?

00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:00.051
Miss?

00:21:02.054 --> 00:21:03.263
What do I do...

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:09.311
Chief? Where are you?

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:13.774
I don't believe this...

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.743
Chief?

00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.261
Min-Ji? Hello?

00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:13.166
What is it?

00:22:16.795 --> 00:22:17.963
What's happening?

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:22.134
Holy shit!

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:35.355
One moment, please!

00:22:59.046 --> 00:23:01.423
Hurry! Everyone run!

00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:06.845
Conductor, we have a situation!

00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:10.432
Sir, violence broke out in the cabin!

00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:24.571
Run!

00:23:44.883 --> 00:23:46.969
- Oh my god!
- What the hell?!

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.356
Get away! Just go!

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.116
Get out of here! Head for the back!

00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:10.826
Get up! Hurry!

00:24:32.764 --> 00:24:34.057
Daddy!

00:25:16.058 --> 00:25:17.434
Baby?

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.104
Sang-Hwa! So damn loud!

00:25:21.188 --> 00:25:23.065
Sorry, the thing is...

00:25:23.106 --> 00:25:24.566
Get off me!

00:25:36.245 --> 00:25:37.996
You idiot! Go help her!

00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:41.500
Hey!

00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:42.583
What's with you?!

00:25:46.421 --> 00:25:48.173
Are you nuts?

00:26:02.896 --> 00:26:04.273
Baby?

00:26:04.523 --> 00:26:06.358
Sung-Kyung!

00:26:07.526 --> 00:26:10.362
You can run, right?

00:26:26.962 --> 00:26:29.590
Massive violence, increasing casualties

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.884
get away!

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.270
Get the door! The door!

00:26:45.939 --> 00:26:47.232
Shut the door!

00:26:48.567 --> 00:26:49.860
Quick!

00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:51.987
Shut it!

00:26:53.572 --> 00:26:54.698
Shut it now!

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.910
Just shut it!

00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:06.877
I know him!

00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:21.683
Where's the lock?

00:27:22.643 --> 00:27:24.520
Buddy! How do I lock this?

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.190
Do you hear me?!

00:27:32.236 --> 00:27:33.695
Let it go.

00:27:34.071 --> 00:27:35.071
What?

00:27:38.075 --> 00:27:40.369
I don't think they know how to work it.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.381
They attacked when they saw us.

00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:14.319
What in the...

00:28:14.945 --> 00:28:16.822
What are they?

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.202
Su-an, you okay?

00:28:23.579 --> 00:28:24.997
Hey, buddy.

00:28:25.914 --> 00:28:27.291
What is it?

00:28:28.542 --> 00:28:30.502
Think you might owe me an apology?

00:28:30.836 --> 00:28:32.129
What do you mean?

00:28:32.379 --> 00:28:33.755
Look at this chump.

00:28:34.298 --> 00:28:37.259
You shut the door in our faces, asshole!

00:28:37.342 --> 00:28:40.012
You weren't the only ones in danger!

00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:43.015
What a piece of work.

00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:44.641
Come over here.

00:28:44.725 --> 00:28:46.393
I'll feed you to them.

00:28:46.476 --> 00:28:47.853
Stop it!

00:28:48.061 --> 00:28:49.688
Everyone's just scared.

00:28:54.526 --> 00:28:56.445
Attention, please.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:01.825
Due to the current situation,
we will no longer be stopping in Cheonan.

00:29:02.242 --> 00:29:05.871
For your safety, please
remain in your seats.

00:29:11.293 --> 00:29:13.378
Hello? Anyone there?

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.422
Yes, go ahead.

00:29:15.506 --> 00:29:19.343
Do you even know what's going on back here?

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.094
Why aren't you stopping in Cheonan?

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.554
We are aware, sir.

00:29:22.638 --> 00:29:26.141
This is an order from our control center.

00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:27.476
Please be seated.

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:32.189
That's nonsense! People are going rabid!

00:29:32.606 --> 00:29:34.983
Stop in Cheonan, got it?!

00:29:36.318 --> 00:29:37.819
Excuse me.

00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:44.201
I'm really sorry, but could she sit down?

00:29:44.284 --> 00:29:45.661
She's pregnant.

00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:46.620
Okay.

00:29:46.787 --> 00:29:47.538
Sit, sit.

00:29:47.746 --> 00:29:48.746
Thank you.

00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:50.833
Mother

00:29:52.626 --> 00:29:53.418
mom.

00:29:53.585 --> 00:29:57.297
Are you on your way?

00:29:58.131 --> 00:29:59.800
Yes, we're en route.

00:30:00.717 --> 00:30:02.719
Where are you? Why is it so loud?

00:30:02.845 --> 00:30:06.723
What's happening? Everyone's fighting.

00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:10.811
Are you and Su-an okay?

00:30:11.061 --> 00:30:14.064
Why're you breathing like that?
Are you hurt?

00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:17.484
Seok-Woo, my baby.

00:30:18.068 --> 00:30:22.781
Please take care of Su-an.

00:30:22.948 --> 00:30:24.575
Mom, you okay?

00:30:25.617 --> 00:30:28.704
My dear Su-an...

00:30:31.623 --> 00:30:37.713
I love her so much, but
she only wants her mom...

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.301
That bitch!

00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:51.310
Mom?

00:30:53.562 --> 00:30:54.730
Dad.

00:30:57.107 --> 00:30:58.275
Dad!

00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:02.321
Is granny okay?

00:31:09.912 --> 00:31:12.915
What the hell?

00:31:13.624 --> 00:31:15.417
Sweetie, sit down.

00:32:00.087 --> 00:32:01.964
My fellow citizens.

00:32:02.506 --> 00:32:09.137
Violent riots have broken out in
a number of our major cities,

00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:14.142
resulting in multiple civilian
and police injuries.

00:32:14.977 --> 00:32:19.231
These riots have led us to shut down
a number of key districts,

00:32:19.273 --> 00:32:23.861
in an effort to subdue those
attempting to destroy

00:32:24.194 --> 00:32:26.947
or take over government property.

00:32:28.699 --> 00:32:32.369
For this reason, we're declaring
a state of emergency

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:39.293
in order to stabilize
and control the current situation.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:47.926
Thanks to our government's rapid response,

00:32:48.302 --> 00:32:52.014
a number of outbreaks are being contained.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.808
Fellow citizens,

00:32:54.850 --> 00:33:00.522
please refrain from reacting
to baseless rumors,

00:33:01.064 --> 00:33:06.612
zombie
and stay in the safety of your homes.

00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:09.907
We must stay calm and trust our government,

00:33:10.324 --> 00:33:13.452
as we all work together
in facing this current crisis.

00:33:14.578 --> 00:33:18.540
To the best of our knowledge,
your safety is not in jeopardy.

00:33:32.054 --> 00:33:35.432
Analyst Kim

00:33:40.229 --> 00:33:42.523
mommy's phone is off.

00:33:46.276 --> 00:33:49.238
Those in the front, hurry up!

00:33:49.613 --> 00:33:51.323
Su-an, sit over here.

00:33:51.907 --> 00:33:54.201
Don't worry, I'll give her a call.

00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:57.496
Jong-Gil, come sit down.

00:33:57.663 --> 00:33:59.873
You're older. You sit down.

00:33:59.957 --> 00:34:01.124
I'm fine. Take it.

00:34:01.208 --> 00:34:03.043
Baby, let's go over there.

00:34:07.798 --> 00:34:10.092
Ma'am, please take my seat.

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:13.262
- I'm okay.
- No, please sit.

00:34:17.432 --> 00:34:18.432
Child.

00:34:19.184 --> 00:34:20.561
Would you like one?

00:34:23.105 --> 00:34:24.898
Thank you.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.692
What a great kid.

00:34:31.321 --> 00:34:33.949
- We both got seats.
- Keep walking.

00:34:34.741 --> 00:34:36.201
That bag...

00:34:37.494 --> 00:34:39.913
Su-an, you didn't have to do that.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:43.000
- Do what?
- Be so good.

00:34:43.417 --> 00:34:46.503
At a time like this, only
watch out for yourself.

00:34:49.464 --> 00:34:50.924
Answer me.

00:34:55.637 --> 00:34:59.183
Granny's knees always hurt her.

00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:02.102
Sweetie...

00:35:06.899 --> 00:35:10.027
May I have your attention, please.

00:35:10.402 --> 00:35:14.239
Our train will terminate service
at Daejeon station.

00:35:14.656 --> 00:35:19.953
Military is deployed at this location
to secure our train,

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:24.166
so once we arrive, please exit the train.

00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:25.876
I repeat,

00:35:26.335 --> 00:35:28.795
Daejeon station will be our last stop.

00:35:29.254 --> 00:35:31.089
Which cities can be entered?

00:35:31.757 --> 00:35:34.510
Yeosu, Uljin, busan. What about Daejeon?

00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:36.178
Excuse me, I need to use it.

00:35:36.803 --> 00:35:38.263
What about Daejeon?

00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:40.015
Why not?!

00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:44.228
Sweetie, stay put.

00:35:48.065 --> 00:35:49.483
Hey, kiddo.

00:35:49.733 --> 00:35:50.359
Yes?

00:35:50.734 --> 00:35:52.486
Who is this? Your dad?

00:35:53.445 --> 00:35:54.071
Yes.

00:35:54.363 --> 00:35:55.823
- Real dad?
- Yes.

00:35:57.074 --> 00:35:58.450
I wanna know.

00:35:59.243 --> 00:36:00.452
What does he do?

00:36:00.702 --> 00:36:02.830
He's a fund manager.

00:36:02.913 --> 00:36:05.249
- Fund manager?
- Yes.

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:08.085
So he's a bloodsucker.

00:36:08.669 --> 00:36:10.504
He leeches off others.

00:36:10.587 --> 00:36:13.799
Don't say that in front of his child.

00:36:13.882 --> 00:36:15.092
It's okay.

00:36:15.217 --> 00:36:18.595
It's what everyone's thinking.

00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:25.853
Want some?

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:28.814
It's what sleepy eats.

00:36:29.982 --> 00:36:32.693
This is sleepy. Say hello.

00:36:33.819 --> 00:36:36.280
Baby's name is sleepy?

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.739
No, the fetus' name.

00:36:37.823 --> 00:36:39.992
It's like a nickname.

00:36:40.075 --> 00:36:44.580
Her dad's too lazy to
come up with a name yet.

00:36:46.582 --> 00:36:47.666
Touch her belly.

00:36:48.041 --> 00:36:49.334
Right here.

00:36:50.544 --> 00:36:51.753
Go on.

00:36:57.217 --> 00:36:58.218
Feel that?

00:36:59.803 --> 00:37:01.889
I made that.

00:37:05.267 --> 00:37:07.728
- You idiot...
- But it's true. No?

00:37:20.657 --> 00:37:23.785
Mr. Suh, you've called me at a bad time.

00:37:23.827 --> 00:37:25.037
Wait, wait!

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.080
Let me ask you something.

00:37:27.122 --> 00:37:28.290
What?

00:37:29.416 --> 00:37:31.168
I'm on ktx to Daejeon.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:35.172
KTX? Right this minute?

00:37:35.339 --> 00:37:37.049
Yes, I'm almost there.

00:37:37.799 --> 00:37:41.053
Is it true military is deployed in Daejeon?

00:37:41.678 --> 00:37:44.056
Yes, that's correct.

00:37:44.306 --> 00:37:48.435
Is that so? It must be safe there.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.147
Well... it's...

00:37:53.941 --> 00:37:57.486
Min. It is safe, right?

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:02.741
Once you arrive, you'll be quarantined.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.159
What?

00:38:07.621 --> 00:38:09.957
I'm with my daughter.

00:38:10.999 --> 00:38:14.545
Can you help us?

00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:17.089
The thing is...

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:21.009
I'll get you a real scoop.
Do me this favor.

00:38:22.803 --> 00:38:26.849
Don't go to the main square.
Come to the east one.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.684
I'll let my men know.

00:38:28.976 --> 00:38:32.396
Okay, thank you. Thank you so much.

00:38:39.695 --> 00:38:42.197
All dead...

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.590
What's going on?

00:38:59.882 --> 00:39:00.716
So quiet...

00:39:00.841 --> 00:39:01.884
Is it Daejeon?

00:39:09.474 --> 00:39:10.475
There's nobody.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.020
Why isn't anyone here?

00:39:30.454 --> 00:39:32.206
Out of my way.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.132
What's going on back there?

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:30.514
This is the violent
incident I told you about.

00:40:30.639 --> 00:40:31.682
Conductor!

00:40:31.765 --> 00:40:33.267
- You're the conductor?
- Yes.

00:40:34.434 --> 00:40:35.834
How many can fit in the engine car?

00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:38.313
We have to uncouple it and go to busan.

00:40:38.397 --> 00:40:39.439
- Uncouple?
- Yes!

00:40:39.523 --> 00:40:41.275
- We can't!
- Why not?!

00:40:41.358 --> 00:40:42.985
It can't be done here.

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:46.655
Then where's the military?

00:40:46.738 --> 00:40:47.738
Right...

00:40:47.948 --> 00:40:49.950
I only just received a report on that...

00:40:49.992 --> 00:40:52.161
Where's my business card...

00:40:52.744 --> 00:40:55.622
I'm coo of stallion express.

00:40:55.914 --> 00:40:58.083
All routes into Daejeon are cut off.

00:40:58.167 --> 00:40:59.835
All buses were rerouted.

00:40:59.918 --> 00:41:01.086
But what for?

00:41:01.128 --> 00:41:03.463
The city's been quarantined!

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:05.591
They probably won't let us in.

00:41:05.841 --> 00:41:10.220
But busan is still open! Let's go there!

00:41:10.304 --> 00:41:12.723
Wait, if that's true...

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.642
- We have to take the others.
- Take who?

00:41:16.226 --> 00:41:17.853
Let's check the station first.

00:41:18.061 --> 00:41:19.354
Hey!

00:41:22.065 --> 00:41:23.317
Dammit!

00:41:45.464 --> 00:41:48.258
Restricted area

00:42:05.984 --> 00:42:07.653
don't mind them.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.660
Come on, sweetie.

00:42:14.701 --> 00:42:15.869
Where are we going?

00:42:17.079 --> 00:42:18.455
We're going this way.

00:42:18.622 --> 00:42:21.834
- Just us?
- Yes. Let's go.

00:42:27.673 --> 00:42:29.091
What is it?

00:42:31.009 --> 00:42:32.386
I'm going this way, too.

00:42:33.053 --> 00:42:35.889
Main square is that way,
just follow the others.

00:42:35.973 --> 00:42:37.808
I think I'll be going with you.

00:42:38.767 --> 00:42:40.602
I heard your call.

00:42:40.978 --> 00:42:43.272
About pulling you two out.

00:42:45.023 --> 00:42:47.276
I know the others go in quarantine.

00:42:48.986 --> 00:42:50.779
It's not true, Su-an.

00:42:50.904 --> 00:42:52.364
I'll go tell the others.

00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:56.076
- You don't have to.
- Of course I do!

00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:58.787
Forget them! We're on our own!

00:43:00.247 --> 00:43:04.168
You only care about yourself.

00:43:06.378 --> 00:43:10.382
That's why mommy left.

00:43:29.234 --> 00:43:30.444
Sweetie...

00:43:34.323 --> 00:43:36.533
Here! Over here!

00:43:36.658 --> 00:43:38.660
Please help!

00:43:38.702 --> 00:43:41.079
Sweetie, stay right here.

00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:02.768
Goddammit!

00:44:04.811 --> 00:44:05.979
Hold on!

00:44:17.491 --> 00:44:19.076
Go back up! Go! Go!

00:44:37.344 --> 00:44:37.970
Lt. Min!

00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:39.471
- Mr. Suh!
- I'm in Daejeon.

00:44:39.513 --> 00:44:42.015
Is everything okay there?
I can't contact my men!

00:44:42.224 --> 00:44:43.225
What?

00:44:43.642 --> 00:44:44.393
Hello?

00:44:44.476 --> 00:44:46.144
Help me...

00:44:48.897 --> 00:44:49.897
Please...

00:45:20.929 --> 00:45:22.014
Come on, hurry!

00:45:27.853 --> 00:45:28.853
Come on! Hurry!

00:45:42.326 --> 00:45:43.911
Hurry up! Quick!

00:45:45.245 --> 00:45:46.455
Take this!

00:46:04.556 --> 00:46:05.974
Run! Come on!

00:46:11.271 --> 00:46:12.523
Asshole! Come on!

00:46:20.697 --> 00:46:21.949
Faster!

00:46:24.326 --> 00:46:25.536
Hold them off!

00:46:58.902 --> 00:47:02.990
- Over here! Run!
- This way! Hurry!

00:47:03.532 --> 00:47:04.533
Here!

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.580
This way!

00:47:10.205 --> 00:47:11.748
Come on!

00:47:11.832 --> 00:47:12.875
Hurry!

00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:15.460
Why aren't we leaving yet?!

00:47:15.794 --> 00:47:17.421
There's still more people!

00:47:17.462 --> 00:47:18.672
Hurry up!

00:47:18.922 --> 00:47:21.341
Come this way!

00:47:22.676 --> 00:47:24.011
Hurry!

00:47:24.344 --> 00:47:25.554
Faster! Here!

00:47:38.942 --> 00:47:40.319
Granny!

00:47:40.402 --> 00:47:42.321
Please get up!

00:47:51.121 --> 00:47:52.789
No, stop!

00:47:53.499 --> 00:47:55.876
My sister!

00:48:02.299 --> 00:48:04.635
Hop on!

00:48:24.446 --> 00:48:25.614
Me too!

00:48:25.948 --> 00:48:28.116
Let me in!

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:29.660
Please!

00:48:47.845 --> 00:48:50.138
How much longer? We've got to go!

00:48:50.264 --> 00:48:51.640
No! My friends aren't here yet!

00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:55.811
Those on board must survive!

00:48:56.019 --> 00:48:57.145
Ain't that right?

00:49:03.861 --> 00:49:05.195
Conductor.

00:49:05.863 --> 00:49:08.365
Please... depart.

00:49:29.553 --> 00:49:30.888
Run! Let's go!

00:49:46.987 --> 00:49:47.946
Look, the train!

00:49:47.988 --> 00:49:48.988
Run faster!

00:50:08.383 --> 00:50:10.135
Snap out of it, idiot!

00:50:39.248 --> 00:50:40.749
Watch out!

00:51:01.687 --> 00:51:06.316
Control, 101 could not dock
at Daejeon due to outbreak.

00:51:06.525 --> 00:51:09.903
Please advise which station
is available for docking, over.

00:51:09.945 --> 00:51:14.700
101, due to unstable communications
it is difficult to advise.

00:51:15.075 --> 00:51:20.080
Control, is 101 clear to reach busan? Over.

00:51:22.875 --> 00:51:25.836
101, we'll clear your route to busan.

00:51:26.128 --> 00:51:27.713
Control center, out.

00:51:28.755 --> 00:51:31.800
Advise when you make contact with busan.

00:51:32.301 --> 00:51:33.927
101, out.

00:52:49.253 --> 00:52:51.922
Attention, everyone.

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:57.302
For the safety of those on board,
we won't be making any stops.

00:52:57.594 --> 00:52:59.847
We're heading straight for busan.

00:53:00.931 --> 00:53:03.517
Conductor, can you hear me?

00:53:03.642 --> 00:53:05.018
Go ahead.

00:53:05.477 --> 00:53:06.812
Were you able to contact busan?

00:53:06.979 --> 00:53:09.815
No. Busan's communications are erratic.

00:53:10.607 --> 00:53:13.735
Full speed-no matter what!

00:53:13.944 --> 00:53:16.446
Or we won't get in. Understand?

00:53:23.787 --> 00:53:25.831
Young-Guk, where are you?

00:53:28.208 --> 00:53:31.253
I thought you were dead!

00:53:31.461 --> 00:53:33.172
I'm sorry.

00:53:35.048 --> 00:53:37.092
No one else made it!

00:53:38.051 --> 00:53:39.469
I'm sorry...

00:53:50.606 --> 00:53:52.983
- Baby?
- Mister!

00:53:53.942 --> 00:53:56.570
Huh? Why are you answering? Where are you?

00:53:56.653 --> 00:53:58.697
We're in the train washroom!

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:01.658
Washroom? Which car?

00:54:01.783 --> 00:54:04.453
Well... it's...

00:54:04.536 --> 00:54:05.829
Car 13!

00:54:05.913 --> 00:54:08.123
- Get your ass over here!
- Baby!

00:54:11.668 --> 00:54:13.962
Was that my kid? Is she okay?

00:54:14.254 --> 00:54:16.381
Washroom. Car 13.

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:32.856
Gonna pass through?

00:54:34.608 --> 00:54:36.860
Let's say you got through and rescued them.

00:54:36.944 --> 00:54:39.071
How do you get back?

00:54:43.075 --> 00:54:44.868
In car 15,

00:54:46.078 --> 00:54:47.871
people are gathered there.

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.295
Car 9

00:55:12.813 --> 00:55:15.023
only four cars away.

00:55:16.692 --> 00:55:18.152
I'll lead,

00:55:19.528 --> 00:55:21.029
you in the middle,

00:55:22.156 --> 00:55:23.657
and you in the back.

00:55:26.577 --> 00:55:28.996
Block anyone attacking from the rear.

00:55:40.799 --> 00:55:43.260
I heard you're a fund manager.

00:55:46.054 --> 00:55:48.056
You're clearly an expert

00:55:48.682 --> 00:55:51.143
at leaving useless people behind.

00:55:57.733 --> 00:56:00.068
Wait till we exit the tunnel.

00:56:14.374 --> 00:56:15.501
Let's go.

00:57:26.989 --> 00:57:28.991
Come on!

00:57:30.534 --> 00:57:31.869
Let's go!

00:57:48.385 --> 00:57:49.636
Move.

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.233
Run!

00:59:32.739 --> 00:59:34.074
Out of the way.

00:59:37.744 --> 00:59:41.456
They stopped once we
entered the tunnel, right?

00:59:42.416 --> 00:59:43.876
Probably because of darkness.

00:59:44.001 --> 00:59:46.378
Yeah. I think so too.

00:59:48.881 --> 00:59:50.799
There's even more here.

00:59:52.134 --> 00:59:53.427
What do we do now?

00:59:54.803 --> 00:59:56.388
There's no way around it.

00:59:56.763 --> 00:59:57.931
Let's go.

01:00:01.894 --> 01:00:04.271
- What?
- Give me your phone.

01:02:08.312 --> 01:02:09.897
Get that out of my face.

01:02:12.524 --> 01:02:13.901
Yo. Jerk.

01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:18.030
Felt good seeing your kid, thanks to me?

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.241
You grateful or what?

01:02:21.408 --> 01:02:24.161
Why is your ringtone so tacky?

01:02:24.912 --> 01:02:27.372
What's wrong with it?

01:02:28.665 --> 01:02:31.084
How do I change it?

01:02:32.377 --> 01:02:36.632
Am I funny? You little rat?

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:38.258
How tall are you?

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.010
5'9".

01:02:40.594 --> 01:02:43.472
6 miles away, at 186mph...

01:02:43.555 --> 01:02:44.932
What?

01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:50.938
Two minutes.
The upcoming tunnel gives us two minutes.

01:02:51.021 --> 01:02:54.066
- Can we do it?
- We gotta.

01:02:54.566 --> 01:02:58.821
If we miss this one,
there's another in about two miles...

01:02:58.904 --> 01:03:03.033
I bet you never got to
play with your daughter.

01:03:04.827 --> 01:03:06.703
When she gets older,

01:03:07.913 --> 01:03:11.083
she'll understand why you worked so hard.

01:03:13.085 --> 01:03:16.463
Dads get all the shit, and no praise.

01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:19.883
But it's all about sacrifice, right?

01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:26.056
What's with the look? Did I sound cool?

01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:36.316
People rescued. Heading over now.

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:39.653
My friend's coming!

01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:42.072
What did you say?

01:03:42.114 --> 01:03:45.242
My friend from the other
car is coming over.

01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:47.536
- Who's coming?
- My friend!

01:03:47.828 --> 01:03:51.415
He was in car 9. He rescued some people.

01:03:51.665 --> 01:03:52.833
Rescued?

01:03:54.418 --> 01:03:59.006
From there to here,
passing through those monsters?

01:04:00.132 --> 01:04:01.842
Without no injuries?

01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:04.761
You sure they're not infected?

01:04:05.888 --> 01:04:08.807
Are you damn sure?!

01:04:10.142 --> 01:04:11.852
What do you mean?

01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:14.646
Look, look at them.

01:04:15.272 --> 01:04:18.275
Right this moment,

01:04:18.442 --> 01:04:21.945
no one knows what's
happened to their families.

01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:27.284
We don't even know
if your damn friends are infected!

01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:30.037
But we're letting them in here?!

01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:36.627
I don't believe this.

01:04:46.136 --> 01:04:47.554
Sir,

01:04:49.723 --> 01:04:52.267
please say something.

01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:54.978
They'll be here soon.

01:04:56.939 --> 01:04:58.649
Sir!

01:08:46.418 --> 01:08:47.836
Get over here!

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.055
One!

01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:01.642
Two!

01:09:07.981 --> 01:09:09.107
Run!

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.331
Jin-Hee! Jin-Hee!

01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:28.585
Hurry the hell up!

01:09:39.054 --> 01:09:39.721
Open up!

01:09:40.013 --> 01:09:42.808
Hey! Open this door!

01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:45.769
Jin-Hee!

01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:47.646
Open this door!

01:10:02.578 --> 01:10:06.248
Open up!

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:18.677
Open it now!

01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:20.095
It won't budge!

01:10:20.637 --> 01:10:21.722
I can't open it!

01:10:21.805 --> 01:10:23.223
Smash it!

01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:24.892
Stand back!

01:10:31.398 --> 01:10:33.066
Hurry up!

01:10:35.444 --> 01:10:37.154
Dammit...

01:11:02.471 --> 01:11:04.765
You stupid idiots!

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:18.779
Come on!

01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:32.125
In-Gil!

01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:38.131
Young-Guk!

01:11:40.759 --> 01:11:42.344
Stand back!

01:11:42.845 --> 01:11:44.012
Young-Guk!

01:12:18.839 --> 01:12:20.048
Stay away!

01:12:27.055 --> 01:12:31.018
Stay back, baby. Please go!

01:12:37.232 --> 01:12:39.193
Buddy, hey!

01:12:41.028 --> 01:12:43.280
Take her and get out.

01:12:43.447 --> 01:12:45.282
You have to go!

01:12:46.408 --> 01:12:48.327
I said go, jerk!

01:12:49.786 --> 01:12:52.122
I'm getting tired. Please go.

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:59.463
Take care of her, okay?

01:13:00.214 --> 01:13:04.051
I'll hold them off. Just go!

01:13:14.353 --> 01:13:17.272
I'm sorry...

01:13:27.074 --> 01:13:29.243
We have to go. Let's go!

01:13:31.036 --> 01:13:32.538
Yoon Su-Yun!

01:13:34.581 --> 01:13:36.542
Our baby's name!

01:13:37.668 --> 01:13:39.002
Got it?

01:15:38.997 --> 01:15:40.833
Why did you do it?!

01:15:42.835 --> 01:15:44.503
You bastard!

01:15:46.129 --> 01:15:48.006
We could've saved them!

01:15:50.092 --> 01:15:51.134
Why?!

01:15:52.553 --> 01:15:54.471
He's infected!

01:15:55.514 --> 01:15:57.057
He's one of them!

01:15:57.975 --> 01:15:59.518
This guy's infected!

01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:01.603
His eyes! Look at his eyes!

01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:04.273
He'll become one of them!

01:16:04.356 --> 01:16:05.649
You all wanna die?!

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:07.776
We've got to throw them out!

01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:21.415
Those of you who just got here...

01:16:22.332 --> 01:16:25.169
I don't think you can stay with us.

01:16:26.503 --> 01:16:28.922
Please move to the vestibule.

01:16:43.687 --> 01:16:44.897
Just go!

01:16:47.983 --> 01:16:51.028
Get out!

01:16:57.493 --> 01:16:58.785
Get out now!

01:17:00.746 --> 01:17:01.955
Hurry up!

01:17:02.789 --> 01:17:04.249
Move!

01:17:06.293 --> 01:17:07.586
Go!

01:17:08.128 --> 01:17:09.379
Leave us!

01:17:09.755 --> 01:17:11.006
Get the hell out!

01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:14.760
Now!

01:17:16.678 --> 01:17:17.888
Hurry!

01:17:21.391 --> 01:17:24.144
It'll be safer for you here.

01:17:24.228 --> 01:17:27.439
But I don't want to stay.

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:29.733
It's you and me now.

01:17:29.817 --> 01:17:30.859
But...

01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:32.361
Get the hell out!

01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:34.988
What are you waiting for!

01:17:35.656 --> 01:17:37.032
Okay, let's go.

01:17:39.535 --> 01:17:42.412
Get out! Rest of you!

01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:43.914
Get out!

01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:46.333
Get out of here!

01:18:04.143 --> 01:18:05.310
Let's go.

01:18:42.723 --> 01:18:44.099
Tie it faster!

01:18:45.058 --> 01:18:45.976
More ties! Neckties!

01:18:46.018 --> 01:18:49.021
Shut up! I'm working on it!

01:19:04.578 --> 01:19:05.996
You idiot.

01:19:06.622 --> 01:19:08.081
Good riddance.

01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:13.545
Always helping others before yourself.

01:19:17.508 --> 01:19:19.968
Why'd you have to do that?

01:19:21.094 --> 01:19:23.555
What was the point?

01:19:24.848 --> 01:19:26.517
So stupid...

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.942
Shut up! Be quiet!

01:19:36.068 --> 01:19:37.402
Stay in your seat!

01:19:38.612 --> 01:19:41.114
What a load of shit.

01:19:45.911 --> 01:19:48.330
Finish up. Do the other side too.

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:03.220
Thank you for everything.

01:20:04.388 --> 01:20:05.430
That woman...

01:20:05.514 --> 01:20:07.724
Stop her!

01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:03.780
Control, this is busan-bound 101!

01:21:03.822 --> 01:21:06.074
Requesting current
situation in busan, over.

01:21:07.576 --> 01:21:08.702
Control?!

01:21:09.119 --> 01:21:10.412
Control!

01:22:36.665 --> 01:22:38.625
It's your birthday...

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.256
Don't worry.

01:22:45.048 --> 01:22:47.134
I'll take you to mom, no matter what.

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:53.348
Aren't you scared?

01:22:58.937 --> 01:23:00.481
Of course I am.

01:23:02.232 --> 01:23:03.817
I'm scared, too.

01:23:08.155 --> 01:23:10.407
I was so scared.

01:23:11.033 --> 01:23:14.244
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:23:16.246 --> 01:23:21.126
I practiced that song just for you.

01:23:25.589 --> 01:23:27.674
That's why I couldn't sing.

01:23:29.885 --> 01:23:31.845
Because I didn't see you.

01:23:39.269 --> 01:23:42.064
Will you stay with me?

01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:59.665
Ex-wife

01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:15.264
the person you have dialed is unavailable.

01:24:24.314 --> 01:24:28.527
Analyst Kim

01:24:30.654 --> 01:24:31.864
yes, Kim.

01:24:33.448 --> 01:24:35.159
Have you arrived in busan?

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.287
Not yet. Where are you? Is it okay there?

01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:42.416
Busan succeeds in primary defense.

01:24:42.749 --> 01:24:45.711
What? You sure?

01:24:45.794 --> 01:24:47.546
Where did you get that info?

01:24:48.255 --> 01:24:52.759
Sir, this was started at YS biotech.

01:24:55.012 --> 01:24:59.183
The centerpiece of our plan!

01:25:03.395 --> 01:25:04.771
Sir!

01:25:05.147 --> 01:25:08.692
This has nothing to do with us... right?

01:25:09.526 --> 01:25:11.987
We only did what we were told.

01:25:12.362 --> 01:25:16.116
Is this my fault?

01:25:19.328 --> 01:25:20.537
It's...

01:25:21.497 --> 01:25:23.874
It's not your fault.

01:25:26.919 --> 01:25:28.045
Thank you...

01:25:30.172 --> 01:25:31.548
Kim...

01:27:16.487 --> 01:27:18.322
Attention, please.

01:27:18.697 --> 01:27:22.659
Due to a track blockage,

01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:25.078
we have stopped at east Daegu station.

01:27:25.287 --> 01:27:28.957
We will be waiting for the rescue team,

01:27:29.291 --> 01:27:33.587
or disembarking for another train to busan

01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:36.965
when this announcement is concluded,

01:27:37.007 --> 01:27:42.471
I will find a working train
and put it on the far left track.

01:27:42.513 --> 01:27:43.263
What's going on?

01:27:43.305 --> 01:27:45.849
I repeat, far left track.

01:27:46.391 --> 01:27:51.188
If you're alive, please transfer safely.

01:27:53.148 --> 01:27:54.900
Godspeed.

01:29:00.174 --> 01:29:02.426
Will there be a rescue?

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.222
I heard busan is safe.

01:29:09.266 --> 01:29:10.976
We have to move now.

01:30:05.906 --> 01:30:07.074
Oh, no.

01:30:55.998 --> 01:30:57.166
Coast clear?

01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:01.378
Yeah.

01:31:04.214 --> 01:31:05.507
You go ahead.

01:31:29.823 --> 01:31:32.242
Have to find a way across.

01:31:55.432 --> 01:31:56.558
What in the...

01:32:09.279 --> 01:32:10.322
Over here!

01:32:47.484 --> 01:32:48.484
No...

01:32:48.694 --> 01:32:49.903
Oh, no...

01:32:52.072 --> 01:32:53.282
What now?

01:32:54.449 --> 01:32:57.369
We've gotta move. Come on!

01:33:04.501 --> 01:33:06.628
Jin-Hee, let's go!

01:33:22.519 --> 01:33:23.519
Stand back!

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.035
Jin-Hee!

01:33:52.049 --> 01:33:53.467
Jin-Hee!

01:34:04.853 --> 01:34:06.396
This can't be...

01:34:12.444 --> 01:34:13.779
I'm sorry...

01:34:39.513 --> 01:34:46.395
Daddy! Wake up!

01:34:47.062 --> 01:34:51.108
Daddy! Daddy!

01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:08.792
What's going on?

01:35:12.421 --> 01:35:15.132
Come on, faster! Faster!

01:35:15.299 --> 01:35:16.467
Hurry!

01:35:21.847 --> 01:35:23.765
Dammit!

01:35:40.157 --> 01:35:41.909
Help...

01:36:24.451 --> 01:36:26.411
Sweetie, come here!

01:36:30.541 --> 01:36:32.501
Su-an, Su-an!

01:36:48.892 --> 01:36:50.519
Mister!

01:37:08.453 --> 01:37:09.454
Sweetie!

01:37:09.496 --> 01:37:11.915
Su-an, come here!

01:37:11.957 --> 01:37:12.791
Mister...

01:37:12.875 --> 01:37:15.252
Go! Hurry!

01:37:15.586 --> 01:37:16.920
Come on!

01:37:17.087 --> 01:37:18.422
Hurry!

01:37:40.235 --> 01:37:41.235
Let's go!

01:39:04.695 --> 01:39:06.530
Hurry! Hurry!

01:39:09.533 --> 01:39:11.118
Daddy!

01:41:32.426 --> 01:41:33.635
Mister...

01:41:35.095 --> 01:41:36.763
I'm scared.

01:41:39.766 --> 01:41:41.518
Take me home.

01:41:41.685 --> 01:41:46.732
My mom is waiting for me...

01:41:50.694 --> 01:41:52.279
My address is...

01:41:53.113 --> 01:41:56.992
Suyoung district, busan...

01:42:00.245 --> 01:42:02.414
Please help me!

01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:07.169
You...

01:42:08.212 --> 01:42:09.546
You're infected.

01:42:15.594 --> 01:42:16.845
No...

01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:19.640
No.

01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:21.558
No!

01:42:22.434 --> 01:42:26.605
I can't be! No!

01:42:52.965 --> 01:42:54.258
Daddy!

01:43:33.714 --> 01:43:35.716
Daddy!

01:44:46.328 --> 01:44:48.038
Daddy!

01:44:52.835 --> 01:44:54.378
Su-an, come here.

01:44:54.545 --> 01:44:56.755
Sit down. Over there.

01:44:57.089 --> 01:44:58.215
Sung-Kyung.

01:44:59.508 --> 01:45:01.385
Listen to me. Pay attention, now.

01:45:02.177 --> 01:45:04.429
This must be the brake.

01:45:04.847 --> 01:45:09.101
When it's safe, pull this. Got it?

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:16.650
Sweetie.

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.946
Look at me, Su-an. It's okay.

01:45:25.534 --> 01:45:27.161
Look at me, sweetie.

01:45:28.328 --> 01:45:30.956
Su-an, listen to me.

01:45:32.458 --> 01:45:36.170
Stay with her, no matter what. Okay?

01:45:39.256 --> 01:45:41.675
It'll be safe in busan.

01:45:41.758 --> 01:45:43.260
Don't go!

01:45:44.094 --> 01:45:46.763
Don't go, it's my fault!

01:45:47.639 --> 01:45:49.725
Daddy, don't go...

01:45:49.933 --> 01:45:51.685
Don't go...

01:45:52.895 --> 01:45:54.521
Please...

01:45:56.523 --> 01:45:58.192
Don't...

01:45:59.735 --> 01:46:04.281
Stay with me, please don't go...

01:46:06.492 --> 01:46:08.035
Please!

01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:11.622
Don't go!

01:46:13.499 --> 01:46:15.417
Please don't go!

01:46:19.963 --> 01:46:22.800
Don't go! No!

01:46:25.344 --> 01:46:27.805
Daddy!

01:51:33.527 --> 01:51:34.987
Look.

01:51:43.662 --> 01:51:45.998
2 bogeys approaching from the tunnel.

01:51:46.081 --> 01:51:48.709
Presumably one woman, one child, over.

01:51:50.419 --> 01:51:52.880
Check for infection, over.

01:51:55.966 --> 01:51:59.011
Where did you just come from?

01:52:03.432 --> 01:52:05.601
Unable to verify.

01:52:07.769 --> 01:52:09.771
Unable to verify on visual.

01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:11.815
Please advise, over.

01:52:13.692 --> 01:52:15.444
Kill them. Over.

01:52:36.298 --> 01:52:41.678
# Proudly swept the rain by the cliffs #

01:52:42.805 --> 01:52:48.852
# as it glided through the trees #

01:52:50.187 --> 01:52:56.401
# still following ever the bud #

01:52:56.985 --> 01:53:03.575
# the 'Ahihi Lehua of the vale #

01:53:04.868 --> 01:53:07.162
Survivors approaching!

01:53:09.623 --> 01:53:13.001
# Aloha 'oe #

01:53:13.085 --> 01:53:19.550
# We'll meet again when the flowers bloom #

01:53:19.758 --> 01:53:23.095
# Aloha 'oe #

01:53:23.262 --> 01:53:26.807
# Aloha 'oe #

01:53:27.099 --> 01:53:32.563
# Until we meet again #

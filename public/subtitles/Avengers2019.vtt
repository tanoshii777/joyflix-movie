BARTON: Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:12.334
- You see where you're going?
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:13.268
Okay.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.406
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:18.040
Gotta move
your foot here.

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.843
Point your toe this way.

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:21.643
Your hips here.

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:23.113
Okay?

00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:25.180
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

00:00:25.182 --> 00:00:26.315
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:27.850
How about now?
Can you see now?

00:00:27.852 --> 00:00:29.384
- (CHUCKLES) No.
- How about now?

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:30.688
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:32.523
All right.

00:00:33.057 --> 00:00:35.192
Ready? Three fingers.

00:00:35.793 --> 00:00:37.093
COOPER: Nice!

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:40.162
LAURA: Nice throw, kiddo.

00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:41.530
COOPER: Here you go.

00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:43.899
Hey, you guys
want mayo? Or mustard?

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:45.701
Or both?

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:47.803
Who puts mayo
on a hot dog?

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:48.904
Probably your brothers.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.038
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.608
LAURA: Got it!

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.244
Nate, mayo or mustard?

00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:56.310
How about ketchup?

00:00:56.312 --> 00:00:58.714
LAURA: Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

00:00:58.716 --> 00:00:59.783
BARTON: Mind your elbow.

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:03.952
(LAUGHS)
Good job, hawk-eye.

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:06.724
Go get your arrow.
(CHUCKLES)

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:09.958
LAURA: Hey, guys!

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.460
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:13.427
BARTON: All right.

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.064
We're coming.
We're hungry.

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.567
Lila, let's go.

00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:21.804
Lila?

00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:25.742
Honey?

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:30.713

(WHISTLES) Boys!

You don't need
to do that.

00:02:39.414 --> 00:02:42.350
Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:44.751
- Oh, yeah.
- (GRUNTS)

00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:47.454
- That was close.
- (GRUNTS)

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:49.388
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.892
I would like to try again.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.795
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

00:02:55.797 --> 00:02:57.363
It's fun.

00:02:57.365 --> 00:02:59.567
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:01.770
And you've won.

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:04.104
Congratulations.

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:05.406
Fair game.

00:03:06.741 --> 00:03:08.175
Good sport.

00:03:08.977 --> 00:03:10.478
You have fun?

00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:14.281

Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:46.512
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
If you find this recording...

00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:49.380
don't post it on social media.

00:03:49.382 --> 00:03:51.684
It's gonna be
a real tearjerker.

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:54.352
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:57.022
I don't even know
if you're still...

00:03:57.024 --> 00:03:58.926
Oh, God, I hope so.

00:03:59.794 --> 00:04:02.127
Today's day 21.

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.863
No, uh, 22.

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:07.632
You know, if it wasn't for
the existential terror...

00:04:07.634 --> 00:04:09.834
of staring into
the literal void of space,

00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:12.370
I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.

00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:13.738
Infection's run its course,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.041
thanks to
the Blue Meanie back there.

00:04:16.043 --> 00:04:17.842
Oh, you'd love her.

00:04:17.844 --> 00:04:19.544
Very practical.

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:21.815
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:28.820
So, the fuel cells were
cracked during battle...

00:04:28.822 --> 00:04:31.089
and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.259
and bought ourselves about
48 hours of flight time.

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:39.296
Uh, but it's now dead
in the water.

00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:42.902
Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.

00:04:44.303 --> 00:04:46.806
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...

00:04:48.208 --> 00:04:49.943
and that'll be it.

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:56.379
Pep, I know I said
no more surprises...

00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:58.216
but I gotta say
I was really hoping

00:04:58.218 --> 00:05:00.184
to pull off one last one.

00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:02.285
But it looks like...

00:05:02.287 --> 00:05:04.323
Well, you know
what it looks like.

00:05:05.457 --> 00:05:07.457
Don't feel bad about this.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:11.095
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

00:05:11.097 --> 00:05:14.399
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

00:05:19.304 --> 00:05:21.371
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:23.542
Go rest my eyes.

00:05:28.947 --> 00:05:32.983
when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

00:05:32.985 --> 00:05:35.954
I'm fine. Totally fine.

00:05:36.488 --> 00:05:37.923
I dream about you.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.059

Couldn't stop him.

00:09:05.026 --> 00:09:06.158
Neither could I.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.495
Hang on.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.499
I lost the kid.

00:09:13.935 --> 00:09:15.603
Tony, we lost.

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:18.840

- Oh, my God!

NATASHA: World governments
are in pieces.

The parts that are
still working...

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.071
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:54.473
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

00:09:54.475 --> 00:09:55.742
Thanos wiped out...

00:09:57.944 --> 00:10:01.214
...50% of all
living creatures.

00:10:05.486 --> 00:10:07.552
Where is he now? Where?

00:10:07.554 --> 00:10:09.254
We don't know.

00:10:09.256 --> 00:10:12.726
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

00:10:13.528 --> 00:10:15.226
(SIGHS)

00:10:15.228 --> 00:10:16.263

ROCKET: Oh, he's pissed.

00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:20.901
He thinks he failed.

00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:23.401
Which, of course, he did...

00:10:23.403 --> 00:10:25.636
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:27.038
Honestly,
until this exact second

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.473
I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.

00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:29.874
Maybe I am.

00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:31.509
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

00:10:31.511 --> 00:10:33.710
Deep space scans...

00:10:33.712 --> 00:10:35.882
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

00:10:37.517 --> 00:10:38.582
Tony, you fought him.

00:10:38.584 --> 00:10:39.785
Who told you that?

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.486
I didn't fight him.

00:10:41.488 --> 00:10:43.088
No, he wiped my face
with a planet...

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.489
while the Bleecker Street
magician

00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:45.756
gave away the store.

00:10:45.758 --> 00:10:46.990
That's what happened.

00:10:46.992 --> 00:10:48.326
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:51.196
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

00:10:51.198 --> 00:10:52.731
Uh... (SPUTTERS)

00:10:53.933 --> 00:10:55.666
I saw this coming
a few years back.

00:10:55.668 --> 00:10:57.768
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.471
Thought I was dreaming.

00:10:59.473 --> 00:11:00.604
Tony, I'm gonna
need you to focus.

00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:02.540
And I needed you.

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:03.740
As in, past tense.

00:11:03.742 --> 00:11:07.244
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

00:11:07.246 --> 00:11:08.912
Sorry.

00:11:08.914 --> 00:11:12.616
(SNIFFS) You know what I need?
I need a shave.

00:11:12.618 --> 00:11:15.219
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

00:11:15.221 --> 00:11:16.186
Tony, Tony!

00:11:16.188 --> 00:11:19.756
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

00:11:19.758 --> 00:11:21.725
was a suit of armor
around the world.

00:11:21.727 --> 00:11:22.960
Remember that?

00:11:22.962 --> 00:11:25.596
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

00:11:25.598 --> 00:11:26.930
That's what we needed.

00:11:26.932 --> 00:11:28.298
Well, that didn't
work out, did it?

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.765
I said we'd lose.

00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:32.536
You said, "We'll do that
together, too."

00:11:32.538 --> 00:11:33.937
And guess what, Cap?

00:11:33.939 --> 00:11:35.539
We lost.

00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:36.741
And you weren't there.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.309
But that's what
we do, right?

00:11:39.311 --> 00:11:42.212
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

00:11:42.214 --> 00:11:44.515
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

00:11:44.517 --> 00:11:45.648
- Okay.
- Right?

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.916
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

00:11:46.918 --> 00:11:48.218
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.685
- She's great by the way.
- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

00:11:49.687 --> 00:11:51.321
TONY: We need you.
You're new blood.

00:11:51.323 --> 00:11:54.525
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

00:11:54.527 --> 00:11:55.892
I got no coordinates...

00:11:55.894 --> 00:11:58.828
no clues, no strategies,
no options.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.730
Zero. Zip. Nada.

00:12:00.732 --> 00:12:02.734
No trust, liar.

00:12:07.172 --> 00:12:08.504
Here, take this.

00:12:08.506 --> 00:12:10.808
You find him,
you put that on...

00:12:11.176 --> 00:12:12.810
you hide.

00:12:13.845 --> 00:12:15.945

RHODES: Bruce gave him
a sedative.

00:12:25.323 --> 00:12:27.258

take care of him...

00:12:29.826 --> 00:12:31.462
and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.262
Where are you going?

00:12:33.264 --> 00:12:34.998
To kill Thanos.

00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:39.067
NATASHA: Hey.

00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:41.304
You know, we usually work
as a team here...

00:12:41.306 --> 00:12:43.172
and, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

00:12:43.174 --> 00:12:45.774
We realize up there

Clearly, your friend is fine.

00:28:49.022 --> 00:28:50.522
You know,
I saw a pod of whales

00:28:50.524 --> 00:28:51.756
when I was coming over
the bridge.

00:28:51.758 --> 00:28:53.758
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships...

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.093
cleaner water.

00:28:55.095 --> 00:28:57.262
You know, if you're
about to tell me

00:28:57.264 --> 00:28:59.397
to look on the bright side...

00:28:59.399 --> 00:29:00.767
Um...

00:29:01.535 --> 00:29:02.901
I'm about to hit you
in the head

00:29:02.903 --> 00:29:05.270
with a peanut butter sandwich.

00:29:05.272 --> 00:29:06.273
Hmm.

00:29:07.174 --> 00:29:08.439
Sorry.

00:29:08.441 --> 00:29:09.775
Force of habit.

00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:25.390
You know,
I keep telling everybody

00:29:25.392 --> 00:29:27.358
they should move on...

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.961
and grow.

00:29:30.129 --> 00:29:31.364
Some do.

00:29:34.733 --> 00:29:36.335
But not us.

00:29:37.036 --> 00:29:39.470
If I move on, who does this?

00:29:39.472 --> 00:29:41.774
Maybe it doesn't need
to be done.

00:29:45.744 --> 00:29:48.147
I used to have nothing.

00:29:49.281 --> 00:29:51.217
And then I got this.

00:29:53.352 --> 00:29:55.221
This job.

00:29:57.523 --> 00:29:59.325
This family.

00:30:04.964 --> 00:30:07.066
And I was better
because of it.

00:30:13.072 --> 00:30:16.908
And even though
they're gone...

00:30:20.679 --> 00:30:23.215
I'm still trying to be better.

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.786
I think we both
need to get a life.

00:30:31.222 --> 00:30:32.458
You first.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.894
(DEVICE CHIMES)

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.295
SCOTT: (ON SPEAKERS)
Oh, hi, hi!

00:30:39.297 --> 00:30:40.597
Uh, is anyone home?

00:30:40.599 --> 00:30:42.298
This is, uh, Scott Lang.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.501
We met a few years ago
at the airport...

00:30:45.503 --> 00:30:47.169
in Germany?

00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:49.538
I was the guy that got
really big. I had a mask on.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.274
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?

00:30:51.276 --> 00:30:54.577
SCOTT: Ant-Man?
I know you know that.

00:30:54.579 --> 00:30:55.777
It's the front gate.

00:30:55.779 --> 00:30:57.313
SCOTT: I really need
to talk to you guys.

00:30:57.315 --> 00:30:59.450
(MUTTERING TO HIMSELF)

00:31:03.388 --> 00:31:04.522
STEVE: Scott.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:06.622
Are you okay?

00:31:06.624 --> 00:31:07.824
Yeah.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.094
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

00:31:12.096 --> 00:31:13.897
Only to make
conversation.

00:31:14.766 --> 00:31:16.766
All right, so...

00:31:16.768 --> 00:31:19.537
five years ago,
right before...

00:31:20.203 --> 00:31:21.404
Thanos...

00:31:21.406 --> 00:31:23.606
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

00:31:23.608 --> 00:31:26.542
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

00:31:26.544 --> 00:31:28.778
To get in there,
you have to be incredibly small.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.415
Hope. She's my, um...

00:31:32.483 --> 00:31:34.251
She was my...

00:31:35.819 --> 00:31:37.118
She was supposed
to pull me out.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.920
And then Thanos happened...

00:31:38.922 --> 00:31:41.022
and I got stuck in there.

00:31:41.024 --> 00:31:43.124
I'm sorry, that must have
been a very long five years.

00:31:43.126 --> 00:31:44.727
Yeah, but that's just it.

00:31:44.729 --> 00:31:45.994
It wasn't.

00:31:45.996 --> 00:31:47.295
For me, it was five hours.

00:31:47.297 --> 00:31:48.830
See, the rules
of the quantum realm

00:31:48.832 --> 00:31:49.964
aren't like
they are up here.

00:31:49.966 --> 00:31:51.733
Everything is unpredictable.

00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:53.234
Is that anybody's sandwich?

00:31:53.236 --> 00:31:54.438
I'm starving.

00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:55.937
Scott.

00:31:55.939 --> 00:31:57.374
What are you
talking about?

00:31:58.375 --> 00:31:59.576
(MUFFLED) So...

00:32:00.544 --> 00:32:02.910
what I'm saying is...

00:32:02.912 --> 00:32:05.580
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

00:32:05.582 --> 00:32:07.349
The only problem is
right now

00:32:07.351 --> 00:32:08.949
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

00:32:08.951 --> 00:32:10.752
But what if we did?

00:32:10.754 --> 00:32:11.985
I can't stop thinking
about it.

00:32:11.987 --> 00:32:14.054
What if we could somehow
control the chaos...

00:32:14.056 --> 00:32:15.490
and we could navigate it?

00:32:15.492 --> 00:32:17.024
What if there was a way...

00:32:17.026 --> 00:32:18.793
that we could enter
the quantum realm

00:32:18.795 --> 00:32:19.993
at a certain point in time...

00:32:19.995 --> 00:32:21.629
but then exit
the quantum realm

00:32:21.631 --> 00:32:22.896
at another point in time?

00:32:22.898 --> 00:32:24.965
Like...

00:32:24.967 --> 00:32:27.167
- Like before Thanos.
- STEVE: Wait.

00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:28.969
Are you talking
about a time machine?

00:32:28.971 --> 00:32:31.905
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

00:32:31.907 --> 00:32:33.142
This is more like a...

00:32:35.244 --> 00:32:37.044
Yeah. Like a time machine.

00:32:37.046 --> 00:32:38.946
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

00:32:38.948 --> 00:32:41.315
(STAMMERS) But I can't stop
thinking about it.

00:32:41.317 --> 00:32:42.518
There's gotta be...

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:44.685
some way... (SIGHS)

00:32:44.687 --> 00:32:46.653
- It's crazy.
- NATASHA: Scott.

00:32:46.655 --> 00:32:48.021
I get emails from a raccoon...

00:32:48.023 --> 00:32:50.824
so nothing sounds crazy
anymore.

00:32:50.826 --> 00:32:53.095
So, who do we talk to
about this?

00:33:11.313 --> 00:33:12.381
Chow time!

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:15.984
Maguna.

00:33:20.021 --> 00:33:21.524
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:23.624
Define "lunch"

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.026
- or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

00:33:26.127 --> 00:33:27.828
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.395
That is part of a special
anniversary gift

00:33:29.397 --> 00:33:30.465
I'm making for Mom.

00:33:34.068 --> 00:33:36.670
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

00:33:36.672 --> 00:33:38.938
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.841
- No.
- That's what you want.

00:33:40.843 --> 00:33:43.075
How did you find this?

00:33:43.077 --> 00:33:45.077
- Garage.
- Really?

00:33:45.079 --> 00:33:47.282
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

00:33:47.982 --> 00:33:50.016
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

00:33:50.018 --> 00:33:51.951
You like going in
the garage, huh?

00:33:51.953 --> 00:33:53.753
So does Daddy. (GRUNTS)

00:33:53.755 --> 00:33:57.024
It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

00:33:59.594 --> 00:34:00.994
So, I'm gonna...

00:34:18.212 --> 00:34:20.913
(STAMMERS) No. We know
what it sounds like.

00:34:20.915 --> 00:34:22.013
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

00:34:22.015 --> 00:34:23.315
is anything really
impossible?

00:34:23.317 --> 00:34:25.383
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

00:34:25.385 --> 00:34:27.185
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

00:34:27.187 --> 00:34:28.553
Can we agree on that?

00:34:28.555 --> 00:34:29.722
Thank you.

00:34:29.724 --> 00:34:32.123
In layman's terms,
it means you're not coming home.

00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:33.458
- I did.
- No.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.427
You accidentally survived.
(SIGHS)

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.696
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

00:34:37.698 --> 00:34:41.168
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

00:34:43.003 --> 00:34:44.402
A time heist?

00:34:44.404 --> 00:34:46.771
Yeah, a time heist.
Of course.

00:34:46.773 --> 00:34:48.073
Why didn't we think
of this before?

00:34:48.075 --> 00:34:50.709
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

00:34:50.711 --> 00:34:52.911
The stones are in the past.

00:34:52.913 --> 00:34:54.312
We could go back,
we could get them.

00:34:54.314 --> 00:34:56.681
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

00:34:56.683 --> 00:34:58.950
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

00:34:58.952 --> 00:35:00.418
I don't believe we would.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.955
Gotta say it. I sometimes
miss that giddy optimism.

00:35:03.957 --> 00:35:05.857
However, high hopes
won't help...

00:35:05.859 --> 00:35:07.893
if there's no logical,
tangible way

00:35:07.895 --> 00:35:11.396
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

00:35:11.398 --> 00:35:13.364
I believe
the most likely outcome

00:35:13.366 --> 00:35:14.699
will be our
collective demise.

00:35:14.701 --> 00:35:17.434
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

00:35:17.436 --> 00:35:20.237
All right? It means no
talking to our past selves...

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:22.007
no betting
on sporting events.

00:35:22.009 --> 00:35:23.810
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

00:35:24.745 --> 00:35:26.110
Are you seriously
telling me

00:35:26.112 --> 00:35:28.078
that your plan
to save the universe...

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.816
is based on
Back to the Future?

00:35:30.918 --> 00:35:32.851
- Is it?
- No.

00:35:32.853 --> 00:35:33.952
Good. You had me
worried there.

00:35:33.954 --> 00:35:35.119
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:37.688
That's not how
quantum physics works.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:38.824
Tony.

00:35:40.793 --> 00:35:42.893
We have to take a stand.

00:35:42.895 --> 00:35:44.797
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

00:35:47.066 --> 00:35:48.899
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:51.468
You got a wife, a daughter.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.204
But I lost someone
very important to me.

00:35:54.206 --> 00:35:55.806
A lotta people did.

00:35:55.808 --> 00:35:59.142
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

00:35:59.144 --> 00:36:00.344
to bring everyone back,

00:36:00.346 --> 00:36:02.012
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

00:36:02.014 --> 00:36:03.849
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

00:36:05.384 --> 00:36:06.951
- I can't.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:08.819
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:11.555
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

00:36:11.557 --> 00:36:14.490
Good job. I'm saved.

00:36:14.492 --> 00:36:16.794
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

00:36:16.796 --> 00:36:17.795
Anything else.

00:36:17.797 --> 00:36:19.863
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

00:36:19.865 --> 00:36:21.230
Oh, look, the table's
set for six.

00:36:21.232 --> 00:36:22.967
Tony. I get it.

00:36:22.969 --> 00:36:25.403
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

00:36:26.038 --> 00:36:28.204
But this is a second chance.

00:36:28.206 --> 00:36:30.874
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

00:36:30.876 --> 00:36:32.510
Can't roll the dice on it.

00:36:34.379 --> 00:36:36.514
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

00:36:39.718 --> 00:36:41.618
Well, he's scared.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.619
STEVE: He's not wrong.

00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:44.921
SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

00:36:44.923 --> 00:36:46.358
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

00:36:47.093 --> 00:36:49.294
No, I wanna do it right.

00:36:52.263 --> 00:36:54.198
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

00:36:55.066 --> 00:36:56.766
Bigger than his?

00:36:56.768 --> 00:36:58.701
Come on, I feel like I'm
the only one eating here.

00:36:58.703 --> 00:36:59.802
Try some of that.

00:36:59.804 --> 00:37:01.203
Have some eggs.

00:37:01.205 --> 00:37:02.572
I'm so confused.

00:37:02.574 --> 00:37:04.407
These are confusing times.
(CHUCKLES)

00:37:04.409 --> 00:37:06.476
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

00:37:06.478 --> 00:37:09.279
Nah, I get it.
I'm kidding!

00:37:09.748 --> 00:37:11.714
I know, it's crazy.

00:37:11.716 --> 00:37:13.016
I'm wearing shirts now.

00:37:13.018 --> 00:37:16.251
Yeah. What? How? Why?

00:37:16.253 --> 00:37:19.221
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

00:37:19.223 --> 00:37:21.057
Except it was worse
for me...

00:37:21.059 --> 00:37:22.357
'cause I lost twice.

00:37:22.359 --> 00:37:24.395
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

00:37:25.096 --> 00:37:26.428
and then, we all lost.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:27.964
No one blamed you, Bruce.

00:37:27.966 --> 00:37:29.466
I did.

00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:32.334
For years, I've been
treating the Hulk

00:37:32.336 --> 00:37:33.702
like he's some kind
of disease...

00:37:33.704 --> 00:37:35.671
something to get rid of.

00:37:35.673 --> 00:37:39.075
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

00:37:39.077 --> 00:37:41.309
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

00:37:41.311 --> 00:37:44.112
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

00:37:44.114 --> 00:37:45.516
and now, look at me.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.417
Best of both worlds.

00:37:48.419 --> 00:37:50.018
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.820
Can we get a photo?

00:37:51.822 --> 00:37:53.955
100%, little person.

00:37:53.957 --> 00:37:56.558
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.627
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- SMART HULK: Thanks.

00:37:58.629 --> 00:38:00.227
Say "green."

00:38:00.229 --> 00:38:02.698
- FANS: Green.
- Green.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.832
Did you get that?

00:38:03.834 --> 00:38:05.667
That's a good one.

00:38:05.669 --> 00:38:08.271
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

00:38:11.607 --> 00:38:13.607
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:14.843
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

00:38:14.845 --> 00:38:16.845
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

00:38:16.847 --> 00:38:17.779
Stranger danger.

00:38:17.781 --> 00:38:19.480
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

00:38:19.482 --> 00:38:20.748
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:21.917
But come on. The kid...

00:38:21.919 --> 00:38:23.384
I don't want a picture
with them.

00:38:23.386 --> 00:38:24.585
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

00:38:24.587 --> 00:38:25.786
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

00:38:25.788 --> 00:38:27.488
- SCOTT: I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.790
- SMART HULK: No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

00:38:29.792 --> 00:38:31.026
SMART HULK: Okay.

00:38:31.028 --> 00:38:32.426
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

00:38:32.428 --> 00:38:34.196
SMART HULK: No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

00:38:34.198 --> 00:38:35.830
ALL: Hulk out!

00:38:35.832 --> 00:38:36.866
STEVE: Bruce.

00:38:37.201 --> 00:38:38.466
Dab.

00:38:38.468 --> 00:38:40.668
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:41.802
She knows better.

00:38:41.804 --> 00:38:43.671
About what we were saying.

00:38:43.673 --> 00:38:44.841
Right.

00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:49.545
The whole time travel
do-over?

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.949
Eh, guys, it's outside
of my area of expertise.

00:38:54.951 --> 00:38:56.984
Well, you pulled this off.

00:38:56.986 --> 00:39:01.023
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

00:39:34.257 --> 00:39:35.755
I've got a mild inspiration.

00:39:35.757 --> 00:39:37.258
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.392
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

00:39:39.394 --> 00:39:41.194
before we pack it in
for the night.

00:39:41.196 --> 00:39:44.264
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

00:39:44.266 --> 00:39:45.832
inverted, please.

00:39:45.834 --> 00:39:46.902
FRIDAY: Processing.

00:39:50.105 --> 00:39:53.006
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

00:39:53.008 --> 00:39:54.941
factoring in spectral decomp.

00:39:54.943 --> 00:39:57.944
- That'll take a second.
- FRIDAY: Just a moment.

00:39:57.946 --> 00:40:01.049
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:04.117
Model rendered.

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:05.352

MORGAN STARK: Shit!

00:40:22.436 --> 00:40:24.336
(WHISPERS) What are you
doing up, little miss?

00:40:24.338 --> 00:40:26.239
- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.

00:40:26.241 --> 00:40:27.539
Only Mommy says that word.

00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:29.209
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

00:40:29.211 --> 00:40:30.442
Why are you up?

00:40:30.444 --> 00:40:31.944
'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

00:40:31.946 --> 00:40:33.213
Why do you think?

00:40:33.215 --> 00:40:34.713
No, I got something
on my mind.

00:40:34.715 --> 00:40:36.316
I got something on my mind.

00:40:36.318 --> 00:40:37.952
Was it juice pops?

00:40:39.386 --> 00:40:40.754
Sure was.

00:40:42.089 --> 00:40:44.022
That's extortion.
That's a word.

00:40:44.024 --> 00:40:45.290
What kind you want?

00:40:45.292 --> 00:40:46.425
Great minds think alike.

00:40:46.427 --> 00:40:48.495
Juice pops exactly...

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.732
was on my mind.

00:40:53.067 --> 00:40:54.367
You done? Yeah?

00:40:54.802 --> 00:40:55.970
Now you are.

00:40:56.469 --> 00:40:57.771
Here. Wipe.

00:41:00.341 --> 00:41:03.208
Good. That face
goes there.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.743
Tell me a story.

00:41:04.745 --> 00:41:06.144
A story.

00:41:06.146 --> 00:41:08.947
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.
The end.

00:41:08.949 --> 00:41:10.381
That is a horrible story.

00:41:10.383 --> 00:41:12.385
Come on, that's
your favorite story.

00:41:12.953 --> 00:41:14.088
Love you tons.

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:17.957
I love you 3,000.

00:41:19.159 --> 00:41:20.160
Wow.

00:41:27.433 --> 00:41:30.536
(WHISPERS) 3,000.
That's crazy.

00:41:31.504 --> 00:41:33.539
Go to bed or I'll sell
all your toys.

00:41:34.507 --> 00:41:36.107
- Night night.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:37.675
Not that it's a competition...

00:41:37.677 --> 00:41:39.944
but she loves me 3,000.

00:41:39.946 --> 00:41:40.945
Does she, now?

00:41:40.947 --> 00:41:44.248
You were somewhere
in the low 6 to 900 range.

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.485
(CHUCKLES)

00:41:50.223 --> 00:41:52.323
Whatcha reading?

00:41:52.325 --> 00:41:54.025
Just a book on composting.

00:41:54.027 --> 00:41:56.095
What's new with composting?

00:41:57.462 --> 00:41:59.698
- Interesting science...
- I figured it out.

00:42:00.767 --> 00:42:01.768
By the way.

00:42:02.467 --> 00:42:03.700
And, you know,

00:42:03.702 --> 00:42:06.103
just so we're talking
about the same thing...

00:42:06.105 --> 00:42:07.673
Time travel.

00:42:08.074 --> 00:42:09.075
What?

00:42:13.246 --> 00:42:14.446
Wow.

00:42:18.318 --> 00:42:19.952
That's amazing...

00:42:20.919 --> 00:42:22.153
and terrifying.

00:42:22.155 --> 00:42:23.722
That's right.

00:42:27.893 --> 00:42:29.061
(SIGHS)

00:42:30.963 --> 00:42:32.862
We got really lucky.

00:42:32.864 --> 00:42:33.997
Yeah.

00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:35.231
I know.

00:42:35.233 --> 00:42:36.499
A lot of people didn't.

00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:38.170
Nope. And I can't
help everybody.

00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:41.371
Sorta seems like you can.

00:42:41.373 --> 00:42:43.075
Not if I stop.

00:42:44.009 --> 00:42:47.112
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

00:42:47.946 --> 00:42:49.511
Tony...

00:42:49.513 --> 00:42:51.081
trying to get you to stop...

00:42:51.083 --> 00:42:53.986
has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

00:42:58.223 --> 00:42:59.958
Something tells me...

00:43:01.193 --> 00:43:02.125
I should put it
in a lockbox

00:43:02.127 --> 00:43:03.929
and drop it to the bottom
of the lake...

00:43:05.097 --> 00:43:06.264
and go to bed.

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:14.805
But would you be able to rest?

00:43:19.177 --> 00:43:22.978
SMART HULK: Okay, here we go.

the, uh, van thing.

00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:30.586
STEVE: Breakers are set.

00:43:30.588 --> 00:43:32.588
Emergency generators
are on standby.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.223
Good, because
if we blow the grid,

00:43:34.225 --> 00:43:37.659
I don't want to lose, uh,
Tiny here in the 1950s.

00:43:37.661 --> 00:43:40.763
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

00:43:40.765 --> 00:43:42.731
You can't say things
like that.

00:43:42.733 --> 00:43:44.668
(STAMMERS)
It was a bad joke.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.903
You were kidding, right?

00:43:47.905 --> 00:43:50.806
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

00:43:50.808 --> 00:43:53.342
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

00:43:53.344 --> 00:43:55.210
We're good!

00:43:55.212 --> 00:43:56.979
Get your helmet on.

00:43:56.981 --> 00:43:58.947
Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...

00:43:58.949 --> 00:44:00.715
let you walk around
for an hour,

00:44:00.717 --> 00:44:02.451
then bring you back
in 10 seconds.

00:44:02.453 --> 00:44:04.186
Make sense?

00:44:04.188 --> 00:44:05.521
Perfectly not confusing.

00:44:05.523 --> 00:44:07.690
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

00:44:08.925 --> 00:44:12.163
You're right.
I do, Captain America.

00:44:14.298 --> 00:44:15.696
On a count of three...

00:44:15.698 --> 00:44:19.667

- What's going on?

- Hold on.
- Is that Scott?

00:44:30.046 --> 00:44:31.047
Yes, it's Scott.

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.517
- What's going on, Bruce?
- Oh, my back!

00:44:36.519 --> 00:44:37.585
- What is this?
- Hold on a second.

00:44:37.587 --> 00:44:38.753

a little space here?

00:44:38.755 --> 00:44:40.021
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

00:44:48.098 --> 00:44:49.030

- It's Scott.
- STEVE: As a baby.

- SMART HULK: He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.

Oh, thank God.

if it was baby me or old me.

It's the EPR Paradox.

00:46:18.019 --> 00:46:19.285
Instead of pushing Lang
through time,

00:46:19.287 --> 00:46:20.386
you might've wound up...

00:46:20.388 --> 00:46:21.854
pushing time through Lang.

00:46:21.856 --> 00:46:23.022
It's tricky, dangerous.

00:46:23.024 --> 00:46:24.723
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

00:46:24.725 --> 00:46:26.025
You did.

Well, thank God
I'm here.

00:46:29.697 --> 00:46:31.399

I just want peace.

00:46:39.674 --> 00:46:42.443
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:18.083
Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.

00:59:18.085 --> 00:59:20.485
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

00:59:20.487 --> 00:59:22.487
Die Hard.
No, that's not one.

00:59:22.489 --> 00:59:23.655
This is known.

00:59:23.657 --> 00:59:25.090
I don't know why
everyone believes that,

00:59:25.092 --> 00:59:26.024
but that isn't true.

00:59:26.026 --> 00:59:28.327
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

00:59:28.329 --> 00:59:30.729
that past becomes
your future...

00:59:30.731 --> 00:59:33.832
and your former present
becomes the past...

00:59:33.834 --> 00:59:36.868
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:38.502
Exactly.

00:59:38.504 --> 00:59:41.607
So Back to the Future
is a bunch of bullshit?

00:59:45.346 --> 00:59:47.412
- All right, Clint.
- (BEEPING)

00:59:47.414 --> 00:59:50.781
We're going in three, two...

00:59:50.783 --> 00:59:51.784
one.

00:59:55.422 --> 00:59:56.756

01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:04.797

(CONTINUES PANTING)

01:01:04.089 --> 01:01:05.489
LILA: Cooper?

01:01:05.491 --> 01:01:07.190
Where are my headphones?

01:01:07.192 --> 01:01:08.324
Lila?

01:01:08.326 --> 01:01:10.428
- COOPER: I never had them.
- Lila?

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:11.495
(BEEPING)

01:01:11.497 --> 01:01:13.198
LILA: Yeah,
you had them yesterday!

01:01:13.665 --> 01:01:15.100
Lila! Lila!

01:01:20.505 --> 01:01:21.706
Yeah, Dad?

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:26.644
Dad?

01:01:29.047 --> 01:01:30.313
Lila!

01:01:30.315 --> 01:01:31.950
(GRUNTING)

01:01:36.221 --> 01:01:38.620
Hey. Hey, look at me.

01:01:38.622 --> 01:01:40.490
You okay?

01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:42.726
Yeah. Yeah.
(PANTING)

01:01:44.463 --> 01:01:45.796
It worked.

01:01:47.399 --> 01:01:48.899
It worked.

01:01:51.802 --> 01:01:54.204
STEVE: Okay, so the how works.

01:01:54.206 --> 01:01:58.107
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

01:01:58.109 --> 01:02:00.075
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

01:02:00.077 --> 01:02:01.944
with at least one
of the six Infinity Stones.

01:02:01.946 --> 01:02:03.679
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:04.813
for "damn near been killed"

01:02:04.815 --> 01:02:06.483
by one of the six
Infinity Stones.

01:02:06.485 --> 01:02:07.683
Well, I haven't...

01:02:07.685 --> 01:02:08.817
but I don't even know

01:02:08.819 --> 01:02:10.152
what the hell
you're all talking about.

01:02:10.154 --> 01:02:13.322
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

01:02:13.324 --> 01:02:15.290
for one round-trip each.

01:02:15.292 --> 01:02:16.325
And these stones have been

01:02:16.327 --> 01:02:18.594
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

01:02:18.596 --> 01:02:19.962
Our history.

01:02:19.964 --> 01:02:23.098
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.136
Which means we have
to pick our targets.

01:02:25.503 --> 01:02:26.904
Correct.

01:02:28.005 --> 01:02:29.804
So, let's start
with the Aether.

01:02:29.806 --> 01:02:31.175
Thor, what do you know?

01:02:36.646 --> 01:02:37.945
NATASHA: Is he asleep?

01:02:37.947 --> 01:02:40.783
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

01:02:43.653 --> 01:02:45.389
Uh, where to start? Um...

01:02:46.923 --> 01:02:49.924
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

01:02:49.926 --> 01:02:52.927
Someone called it
a stone before.

01:02:52.929 --> 01:02:57.432
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

01:02:57.434 --> 01:02:59.200
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

01:02:59.202 --> 01:03:00.701
and stop saying that.

01:03:00.703 --> 01:03:03.472
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

01:03:03.474 --> 01:03:05.507
My grandfather,
many years ago...

01:03:05.509 --> 01:03:09.611
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

01:03:09.613 --> 01:03:12.146
Ooh. (CHUCKLES)
Scary beings.

01:03:12.148 --> 01:03:13.917
So, Jane, actually...

01:03:14.384 --> 01:03:16.184
Oh, there she is.

01:03:16.186 --> 01:03:20.621
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

01:03:20.623 --> 01:03:23.991
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

01:03:23.993 --> 01:03:27.395
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

01:03:27.397 --> 01:03:29.163
and she became
very, very sick.

01:03:29.165 --> 01:03:31.332
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

01:03:31.334 --> 01:03:32.600
which is where I'm from...

01:03:32.602 --> 01:03:34.701
and we had to try
and fix her.

01:03:34.703 --> 01:03:36.337
We were dating at the time,
you see...

01:03:36.339 --> 01:03:40.042
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:43.346
(SIGHS) who's dead and, um...

01:03:44.681 --> 01:03:46.180
Oh, you know, Jane and I

01:03:46.182 --> 01:03:48.349
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

01:03:48.351 --> 01:03:49.283
(MOUTHING)

01:03:49.285 --> 01:03:50.685
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

01:03:50.687 --> 01:03:51.985
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

01:03:51.987 --> 01:03:53.987
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

01:03:53.989 --> 01:03:55.690
The only thing
that is permanent in life

01:03:55.692 --> 01:03:57.226
is impermanence. (LAUGHS)

01:03:57.826 --> 01:04:00.393
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

01:04:00.395 --> 01:04:02.362
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

01:04:02.364 --> 01:04:05.533
ROCKET: Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

01:04:05.535 --> 01:04:08.503
- SMART HULK: Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:11.171
Quill was a person.

01:04:11.173 --> 01:04:13.773
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

01:04:13.775 --> 01:04:15.175
Oh, look.

01:04:15.177 --> 01:04:18.078
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.548
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:22.851
I'll take you to space.

01:04:23.952 --> 01:04:26.219
NEBULA: Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

01:04:26.221 --> 01:04:28.121
What is Vormir?

01:04:28.123 --> 01:04:30.023
NEBULA: A dominion of death...

01:04:30.025 --> 01:04:32.127
at the very center
of celestial existence.

01:04:33.861 --> 01:04:38.065
It's where Thanos
murdered my sister.

01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:43.272

01:04:44.406 --> 01:04:45.440
Not it.

01:04:47.108 --> 01:04:48.874
- NATASHA: That Time Stone guy.
- SMART HULK: Doctor Strange.

01:04:48.876 --> 01:04:50.843
NATASHA: Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:52.978
TONY: Ear-nose-throat

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.514
SMART HULK: Nice place
in the Village, though.

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:56.115
TONY: Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

01:04:56.117 --> 01:04:57.449
SMART HULK:
Mm... Bleecker Street.

01:04:57.451 --> 01:04:58.984
Wait, he lived
in New York?

01:04:58.986 --> 01:05:00.085
TONY: No,
he lived in Toronto.

01:05:00.087 --> 01:05:01.186
Uh, yeah, on Bleecker
and Sullivan.

01:05:01.188 --> 01:05:02.454
Have you been listening
to anything?

01:05:02.456 --> 01:05:03.522
Guys.

01:05:03.524 --> 01:05:05.124
If you pick
the right year,

01:05:05.126 --> 01:05:07.028
there are three stones
in New York.

Shut the front door.

01:05:13.769 --> 01:05:16.001
STEVE: All right.
We have a plan.

01:05:16.003 --> 01:05:20.874
Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

01:05:30.251 --> 01:05:32.353
STEVE: Five years ago,
we lost.

01:05:33.621 --> 01:05:35.055
All of us.

01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:38.292
We lost friends.

01:05:38.858 --> 01:05:40.594
We lost family.

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:44.432
We lost a part of ourselves.

01:05:45.599 --> 01:05:48.268
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

01:05:49.403 --> 01:05:53.137
You know your teams.
You know your missions.

01:05:53.139 --> 01:05:55.275
Get the stones.
Get them back.

01:05:55.942 --> 01:05:57.408
One round-trip each.

01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:58.478
No mistakes...

01:05:58.912 --> 01:06:00.779
no do-overs.

01:06:00.781 --> 01:06:02.613
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

01:06:02.615 --> 01:06:04.884
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:07.020
Be careful.

01:06:07.554 --> 01:06:08.955
Look out for each other.

01:06:10.123 --> 01:06:12.158
This is the fight
of our lives...

01:06:12.859 --> 01:06:14.527
and we're gonna win.

01:06:16.663 --> 01:06:17.863
Whatever it takes.

01:06:20.866 --> 01:06:22.567
Good luck.

He's pretty good at that.

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.036
- Right?
- TONY: All right.

You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

01:06:32.746 --> 01:06:34.345
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:34.347 --> 01:06:36.179
Okay, I'll do my best.

01:06:36.181 --> 01:06:38.217

that was pretty lame.

I can't do this.
I can't do this.

01:10:37.352 --> 01:10:39.118
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.453
It's a bad idea!

01:10:40.455 --> 01:10:41.621
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

01:10:41.623 --> 01:10:44.223
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

01:10:44.225 --> 01:10:45.291
Come here. Right here.

01:10:45.293 --> 01:10:47.126

This is bad.

What do you think
we're doing here?

01:10:50.966 --> 01:10:53.232
I lost the only family
I ever had.

01:10:53.234 --> 01:10:55.902
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

01:10:55.904 --> 01:10:58.005
all gone.

01:10:58.007 --> 01:10:59.705
I get you miss
your mom...

01:10:59.707 --> 01:11:01.008
but she's gone.

01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:02.475
Really gone.

01:11:02.477 --> 01:11:05.678
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.781
and you can help them.

01:11:07.882 --> 01:11:09.348
So, is it too much to ask

01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:11.183

out of your beard...

to Pretty Pants...

01:11:13.788 --> 01:11:17.023
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

01:11:17.025 --> 01:11:18.693
and help me
get my family back?

to turn that prisoner

01:20:17.122 --> 01:20:19.088
Uh, Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

to answer to us.

01:20:20.425 --> 01:20:21.790
Odin can have what's left.

01:20:21.792 --> 01:20:23.293

that case.

I need the case.

If I give up
the Time Stone

01:23:46.828 --> 01:23:48.727
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

01:23:48.729 --> 01:23:50.462
With all due respect,
all right...

01:23:50.464 --> 01:23:53.934
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.273
The Infinity Stones create

01:24:01.275 --> 01:24:03.809

as the flow of time.

01:24:03.811 --> 01:24:05.577
Remove one of the stones...

01:24:05.579 --> 01:24:07.780
and that flow splits.

01:24:07.782 --> 01:24:10.282
Now, this may benefit
your reality...

01:24:10.284 --> 01:24:12.885
but my new one,
not so much.

01:24:12.887 --> 01:24:14.787
In this new branch reality...

without our chief weapon

against the forces
of darkness...

01:24:18.191 --> 01:24:20.459
our world would be overrun.

01:24:20.461 --> 01:24:22.360
Millions will suffer.

01:24:22.362 --> 01:24:24.028
So, tell me, Doctor.

01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:26.498
Can your science
prevent all that?

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.501
No...

01:24:28.502 --> 01:24:29.535
but we can erase it.

01:24:29.537 --> 01:24:31.436
Because once we're done
with the stones...

01:24:31.438 --> 01:24:33.906
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

01:24:33.908 --> 01:24:35.641
at the moment it was taken.

01:24:35.643 --> 01:24:38.211

01:24:39.045 --> 01:24:40.280
in that reality...

01:24:42.749 --> 01:24:44.484

Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

01:24:53.326 --> 01:24:56.027
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

01:24:56.029 --> 01:24:59.363
We will. I will.
I promise.

01:24:59.365 --> 01:25:01.601
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

01:25:03.136 --> 01:25:06.002

of the Sorcerer Supreme

01:25:13.212 --> 01:25:15.682
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

- Yes.

Or I did.

Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

01:25:59.424 --> 01:26:02.227
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

01:41:57.599 --> 01:42:00.469
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?

01:42:02.871 --> 01:42:04.506
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:07.907
- HANK PYM: Hello?
- STEVE: (ON PHONE) Doctor Pym?

01:42:07.909 --> 01:42:10.442
HANK PYM: That would be the
number that you called, yes.

01:42:10.444 --> 01:42:12.946
This is Captain Stevens
from shipping.

01:42:12.948 --> 01:42:14.112
We have a package for you.

01:42:14.114 --> 01:42:15.815
Oh, bring it up.

01:42:15.817 --> 01:42:17.985
That's the thing, sir,
we can't.

01:42:18.887 --> 01:42:21.720
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

01:42:21.722 --> 01:42:23.155
Well, it's just...

01:42:23.157 --> 01:42:24.858
Sir, the box is glowing...

01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:26.191
and to be honest,

01:42:26.193 --> 01:42:27.826
some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.

01:42:27.828 --> 01:42:29.528
They didn't open it,
did they?

01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:32.066
Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.

01:42:32.733 --> 01:42:34.668
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

01:43:01.629 --> 01:43:05.431
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

01:43:06.032 --> 01:43:07.733
Uh, my wife's expecting.

01:43:07.735 --> 01:43:10.603
And too much time
at the office.

01:43:12.472 --> 01:43:13.704
Congratulations.

01:43:13.706 --> 01:43:17.108
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.

01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:19.345
- How far along is she?
- Uh, I don't know.

01:43:20.981 --> 01:43:22.146
She's at the point where

01:43:22.148 --> 01:43:23.714
she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.

01:43:23.716 --> 01:43:27.487
I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.

01:43:28.221 --> 01:43:29.554
I have a little girl.

01:43:29.556 --> 01:43:31.088
A girl would be nice.

01:43:31.090 --> 01:43:33.824
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

01:43:33.826 --> 01:43:35.326
What'd be so awful
about that?

01:43:35.328 --> 01:43:37.395
Let's just say
that the greater good

01:43:37.397 --> 01:43:40.833
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

01:43:44.671 --> 01:43:46.337
GUARD: And you've never seen
these two men before?

01:43:46.339 --> 01:43:48.039
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

01:43:48.041 --> 01:43:49.105
Can you describe them?

01:43:49.107 --> 01:43:50.408
One of them
had a hippie beard.

01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:52.643
GUARD: Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

01:43:52.645 --> 01:43:54.011
FEMALE AGENT:
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

01:43:54.013 --> 01:43:55.111
Yeah, this is Chesler.

01:43:55.113 --> 01:43:56.279
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

01:43:56.281 --> 01:43:58.383
We have
a potential breach.

01:44:16.101 --> 01:44:17.267
PEGGY: I said bring them in.

01:44:17.269 --> 01:44:18.368
They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit

01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:19.569
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

01:44:19.571 --> 01:44:20.470
Oh, for the love of...

01:44:20.472 --> 01:44:22.274
I'll look at
the weather projections.

01:44:23.575 --> 01:44:24.576
(INDISTINCT)

01:44:46.098 --> 01:44:48.299
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

01:44:59.377 --> 01:45:01.276
TONY: So, where you at
with names?

01:45:01.278 --> 01:45:04.513
HOWARD: Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Elmonzo.

01:45:04.515 --> 01:45:06.750
TONY: Huh. Might wanna
let that stew awhile.

01:45:06.752 --> 01:45:08.319
- You got time.
- Uh-huh.

01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:12.022
Let me ask you
a question.

01:45:12.024 --> 01:45:15.357
When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

01:45:15.359 --> 01:45:17.027
- Wildly.
- (SIGHS)

01:45:17.029 --> 01:45:18.927
- Yeah.
- Did you feel qualified?

01:45:18.929 --> 01:45:20.696
Like you had any idea

01:45:20.698 --> 01:45:22.731
how to successfully operate
that thing?

01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:25.934
I literally pieced it
together as I went along.

01:45:25.936 --> 01:45:28.303
I thought about
what my dad did.

01:45:28.305 --> 01:45:29.605
HOWARD: (SIGHS) My old man,

01:45:29.607 --> 01:45:31.473
he never met a problem he
couldn't solve with a belt.

01:45:31.475 --> 01:45:33.842
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

01:45:33.844 --> 01:45:35.176
And now,
looking back on it,

01:45:35.178 --> 01:45:36.545
I just remember
the good stuff.

01:45:36.547 --> 01:45:38.347
You know? He did drop
the odd pearl.

01:45:38.349 --> 01:45:40.749
Yeah? Like what?

01:45:40.751 --> 01:45:43.554
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

01:45:44.822 --> 01:45:46.187
Smart guy.

01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:47.758
He did his best.

01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.525
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

01:45:50.527 --> 01:45:53.229
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

01:46:01.839 --> 01:46:03.339
Good to meet you, Potts.

01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:04.741
Yeah.

01:46:05.076 --> 01:46:06.674
Howard...

01:46:06.676 --> 01:46:08.545
everything's gonna be
all right.

01:46:11.548 --> 01:46:12.749
Thank you...

01:46:13.717 --> 01:46:15.316
for everything...

01:46:15.318 --> 01:46:17.754
you've done
for this country.

01:46:20.657 --> 01:46:21.758
HOWARD: Jarvis.

01:46:25.328 --> 01:46:26.963
Have we ever met
that guy?

01:46:28.965 --> 01:46:30.567
You meet
a lot of people, sir.

01:46:33.069 --> 01:46:34.771
Seems very familiar.

01:46:35.705 --> 01:46:37.272
Weird beard.

You know you want to.

Did you see what happens
in the future?

01:47:14.043 --> 01:47:16.545
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:19.982
You wanna know
how he does that?

01:47:21.283 --> 01:47:25.621
You wanna know
what he does to you?

01:47:26.021 --> 01:47:27.420
That's enough.

You disgust me.

But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

didn't have to climb
a mountain.

Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

01:48:41.729 --> 01:48:43.561
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

Oh, good.

01:49:48.161 --> 01:49:49.930
For the other...

01:49:52.464 --> 01:49:54.531
In order to take
the stone...

01:49:54.533 --> 01:49:57.736
you must lose
that which you love.

01:49:59.039 --> 01:50:02.175
An everlasting exchange.

01:50:03.176 --> 01:50:07.446

01:50:14.753 --> 01:50:16.354

01:50:16.356 --> 01:50:18.123
Maybe he's making
this shit up.

No.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.726
I don't think so.

01:50:22.728 --> 01:50:25.064
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

01:50:26.464 --> 01:50:27.700
I didn't.

01:50:28.901 --> 01:50:31.603
Thanos left here
with the stone...

01:50:32.137 --> 01:50:33.704
without his daughter.

01:50:33.706 --> 01:50:35.975
That's not a coincidence.

01:50:37.042 --> 01:50:38.744
Yeah.

01:50:40.312 --> 01:50:42.214
Whatever it takes.

Whatever it takes.

01:50:52.523 --> 01:50:54.623
If we don't get that stone...

01:50:54.625 --> 01:50:56.561
billions of people stay dead.

01:50:57.262 --> 01:50:58.596
Yeah.

01:51:00.099 --> 01:51:02.600
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

01:51:03.202 --> 01:51:04.535
I guess we do.

01:51:12.677 --> 01:51:14.478
I'm starting to think

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.847
we mean different
people here, Natasha.

I've been trying to do one thing.

01:51:20.051 --> 01:51:21.183
Get to right here.

That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

01:51:25.823 --> 01:51:28.491
What, you think
I wanna do it?

I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

01:51:30.428 --> 01:51:33.628
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

01:51:33.630 --> 01:51:36.000
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

01:51:37.534 --> 01:51:39.569
You know what I've become.

01:51:41.472 --> 01:51:42.637
Oh, I don't judge people

Maybe you should.

01:51:50.381 --> 01:51:52.015
You didn't.

01:51:57.954 --> 01:52:00.324
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

01:52:11.402 --> 01:52:12.769
Okay.

this actually worked?

the stones...

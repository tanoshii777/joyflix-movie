00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.230
Oh, that is beautiful.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.130
It is terrible.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.050
I can't do it.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.630
Hmm, but yet, you will.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.230
You're growing up so fast.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.250
You say that all the time.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.230
Yes, because you are.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.650
You look so much like your sister.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.570
I wish I could run a marathon.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.460
If I come back and you're a foot taller, I could have ground you.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.920
Oh, yes.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.420
Yes.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.100
Yes.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.560
Yes.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.700
Yes.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.100
Come with me.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.660
Stay away.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.709
We opened your hearts to you, we embraced you,

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:23.180
we let you, an outsider, marry a daughter of our clan.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.100
And how did you repay this kindness?

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:37.180
You took what was not rightfully yours, and now your wife is dead, to atone for your transgressions.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.040
Did you think that you could just walk away?

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.260
Hmm?

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.820
Where is she?

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.660
Where is Eve?

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.780
Charlie.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.300
You coward.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.700
You try to convince yourself that fate absolves you of your actions.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.300
There are no choices.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.500
And does that make what you do any easier?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.800
It makes what I do necessary.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:35.710
One bullet, well placed, can be a magical thing.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.490
It's neither good, nor evil.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.890
But how a man uses it, reveals his true character.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.490
You wanted choices.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.850
Well here they are.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.430
You kill yourself, and your daughter lives.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.250
Or kill me, and you and your daughter have died together.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.200
Choice is yours.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.030
You got your choice.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.450
Now you have the balls to do it.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:16.940
Tchaikovsky.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.040
How lovely.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:37.060
At a time of loss there's nothing easier than pity, and nothing more difficult than the truth, as there are no easy answers for grief.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.040
I'd like to be honest with you.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.660
Would that be alright?

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.340
Your father was a good man.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.080
He wanted a free and open life for you.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.120
Not like the one that he had to endure.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.560
But, we all live with the decisions we make.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.300
Now he's been taken from you.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.100
I can do nothing about that.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.740
But what I can do, is offer to take you to his family.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:41.060
They will look after you, and hopefully, one day become your family too.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.860
The director will see you now.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.200
Does she know who her parents really were?

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.430
Come here, sit.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.450
You dance, yes?

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:46.450
I run this theater, and I'm always looking for new recruits.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.240
I know you.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.700
I know your pain.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.560
What boils inside of you under the surface.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.460
I can give you somewhere to put that anger.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.350
Those men took your past.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.450
Don't let them steal your future.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.630
Well?

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.010
She says my path is not yet, but there is still room left.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.290
Very well.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:41.180
Thank you, Mr. Winston.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.680
You are most welcome, Miss Makaro.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.190
I know that I will always be at your service.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.829
My name is Nogi.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.050
Did you know my father?

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.030
I did.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.860
Your father was Roscoe Romo like me, like you will be too.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.630
He was what we call Kikimora.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:36.450
What is that?

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.710
In Slavic mythology, the Kikimora is a kind of spirit.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:48.710
To those with darkness in their hearts, she can be vengeful, and destructive.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.090
Like Tempokino?

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:53.470
Yes.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.870
But to the innocent, she can be a protector.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:13.140
It is two sides to the one coin.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.505
To kill,

00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:21.522
to save,

00:18:23.733 --> 00:18:25.096
but.

00:18:26.274 --> 00:18:27.636
ultimately,

00:18:32.103 --> 00:18:34.609
it is up to you to choose.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.670
Are you finished?

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.570
No.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:45.190
Good.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.950
That will be all for today.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.550
Tend to your wounds before you get sepsis and we have to cut off your feet.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.810
Tell Tatiana she is next.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.570
Her Majesty says you're over.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.470
But Lauren hates me.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.110
She hates everybody.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.700
Christ, Eve.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.160
Why do you push yourself like this?

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.640
I want to be ready.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.960
Ready for what?

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.470
You know what's funny?

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.110
When I was a little girl, I actually did want to be a real ballerina.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.990
You are a real ballerina.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.170
The best dancer here.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.830
I don't know if she'll be by in three weeks.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:31.990
One bullet, while Christ can change the world.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.830
The King Himara's purpose is to stop that bullet.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.850
Hands up!

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:02.070
To become King Himara, you must become the assassin.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:06.570
You must learn to move like him and think like him.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:14.810
For this next exercise, we will be using simulated rounds.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.110
What are the rules?

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.870
Protect your world at all costs.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.290
That is the only rule.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.130
Why did you fail?

00:22:59.130 --> 00:22:59.970
He's too strong.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.630
Do you really believe that strength has anything to do with whether you win or lose?

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.070
You will always be weaker.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.990
You will always be smaller and at a disadvantage.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:18.110
He is beating you because you are allowing him to define the terms of the contest.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:19.930
Do you want to win?

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.910
Change the terms.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.750
Improvise.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:29.630
Adapt.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:30.650
Cheat.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.310
Lean into your strengths.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:35.690
Not his.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.120
Fight like a girl.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:47.670
Begin.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.630
Where is she?

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.300
Tatiana's things are gone.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.540
Did something happen to her?

00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.410
Sit.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.200
Tatiana did not have the qualities required to continue with the Ruska Vanga.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.300
What are you talking about?

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.840
Tatiana, she lacked the killer instinct I see in you.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.920
Your childhood was taken.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.980
This pain is what drives you.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.360
Tatiana, there is sadness, not pain.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.220
There is a difference.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.280
The two are now on different paths.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.960
Then why are you holding me back?

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.900
I'm ready.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.240
Perhaps you are right.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.260
It is time.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.900
This is the final stage of your training.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.350
Oh my God.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.850
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.590
I'm a fucking test?

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.490
How did the money fall?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.480
Do you know who I am?

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.380
I'm you.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.680
In ten fucking years.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.070
All of this for what?

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.030
All this for a puppy?

00:28:18.441 --> 00:28:21.010
He was more than a simple puppy.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.680
Please shut up.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.840
Your ticket is torn.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.660
Shut up.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.670
Thank you for the lifeboat.

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:56.330
Tatiana.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.070
The one they call the Baba Yaga.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.390
The students all talk about you.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.790
The front door is unlocked.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:36.470
Now I mean, how do I start doing what you do?

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.890
Looks like you already have.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.370
That door will lock sooner than you think.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.530
You can still leave.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.310
You still have a choice.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.610
When did you leave?

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.730
The director feels you are ready for your first contract.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.790
You will protect this woman, Kepler Park.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.550
Her father is our primary charge.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:24.390
He is concerned that his competitors may try to get to him by ransoming his daughter.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.030
Your job is to make sure they don't get the chance.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.840
To infiltrate past security,

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:39.110
you will be using a modified, 3D-printed Glock 43X with reinforced carbon fiber barrel and polymer arms.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.380
Rubber bullets?

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:45.940
Problem?

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.230
Now, you will find Ms. Park at minus 11.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:39.030
My friend, stand by.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.030
All right.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:48.890
It's actually a trap.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:09.840
We should get out of the way.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:11.560
I can't.

00:33:13.844 --> 00:33:15.540
I understand.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.360
Stay high enough.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.320
We're safe now.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:56.780
It's fine.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.380
Let's go.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.340
Can we stop getting elevated?

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.800
Yes.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.380
It's better safe than sorry.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.240
Let's go.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.380
Miss, something's leaking from your bag.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.900
Yes, thank you.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:07.920
No problem.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.130
Is there a reason you brought me a severed hand?

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:19.250
Look at the scar.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.870
I've seen this before.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.530
That's the same scar as the man who murdered my father.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:29.810
It was a mark from a tribe.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:32.010
You knew who they were.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:33.170
How dare you?

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:35.470
I have been protecting you.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.070
Why didn't you tell me who they were?

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.570
My child, you do not understand.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:45.970
People with that mark, they have no rules, no consequence, no mercy.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:50.430
They do not interfere with our business, and we do not interfere with theirs.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.010
This is a pact as old as the Ruska Roma itself.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.350
All these rules, who are they serving?

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:02.950
When you deal in blood, there must be rules, or nothing survives.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.830
Why would a tribe try to kidnap a child?

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:07.050
I am warning you.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:08.990
You will not find them.

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:12.090
And hunting for them will only bring chaos.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:16.550
I'm ordering you, do not pursue this.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:18.650
Do I make myself clear?

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:22.840
Yes, ma'am.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.660
Please.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.080
Take your hand.

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.250
Welcome to the Continental.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:14.970
Checking in?

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:15.990
No.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.150
I'd like to speak with the manager.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.310
Is he expecting you?

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:21.570
No, he's not.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:22.750
I see.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:24.990
And what may I ask is your name?

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.710
Eve.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:28.310
Eve Macauro.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:33.850
Let me see what I can do.

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.930
Eve Macauro of the Ruska Roma.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.550
What a pleasure to see you again.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.190
Please.

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.230
So what brings you here?

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.290
I'm looking for the tribe that killed my father.

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:15.770
And if I suggested you didn't?

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:20.010
I would smile and nod, and then ignore you.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:20.870
Ah.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:25.650
The director has already warned me about them and the rules.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.430
So I can appreciate your reluctance.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.030
That's very kind of you.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:33.430
But a few words of advice, if I may, Miss Macauro.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:40.650
Whatever information you think these people have, it might not be in your best interests to know it.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:42.930
I still need to know.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.850
Needing to know is what got us banished from the Garden of Eden.

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:51.530
Are you prepared to be cast out again, Eve?

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:09.920
Very well.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:13.810
I'll give you this.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.010
It's not a tribe, it's a cult.

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:20.610
That kills not just for business, but for sport.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:25.950
Why we live among so-called polite society, they do not.

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:27.190
Where can I find him?

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:30.670
The precise location is unknown.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.130
But we do monitor them when they stay at our hotels.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.070
They have access to the Continentals?

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.870
Oh, yes.

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:43.850
Better to have them inside the tent, pissing out, and outside, pissing in.

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:50.374
And yes, there is a man who bears that mark, staying at one of our hotels in the prison,

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:53.650
- In Prague, I believe.
- Oh, my business.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:01.350
Shall we?

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:17.869
Hello, my dear.

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:23.970
Here you'll be, darling, and bring up the latest Blackwire submissions on Daniel Pine.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:28.250
Daniel Pine.

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:32.430
Contract submitted three days ago, bounty accepted to a million.

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:36.830
He's currently holed up inside the Prague Continental, room 3-1-5.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:45.150
No outside calls have been allotted, and he's purchased an extra odor from service.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:46.970
What's the ice cream?

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:48.770
Sweet Tooth.

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:51.350
Hard copy, please.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.120
Sir, here is a call from the director.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:15.890
Win a square, please, senorita.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:21.450
Checking in?

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:23.050
Certainly.

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.310
And how long will you be staying with us?

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:27.070
Just the night.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:31.850
Room 3-14, please.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.720
Still no word from Pine.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:57.900
Where are my words?

00:49:58.820 --> 00:49:59.840
Keep your eyes on Pine.

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.460
We may have a taker.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:20.530
We have a taker.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.930
A woman.

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.830
Dark.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:24.050
Dark hair.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.140
She's dead.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.660
Who are you?

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:02.170
You're not supposed to say that word.

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:04.490
Right.

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:05.630
Sorry.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:07.530
What's your name?

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:08.510
Hello.

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:10.310
I'm Eve.

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.370
You're not going to hurt my daddy, are you?

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:16.770
Your father?

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.110
Now, come here.

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:37.310
It's going to be all right, but you can stand behind me, senorita.

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:42.790
What do you want?

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:49.020
When I was a child, men with your mark murdered my father.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.080
I just want to know where to find them.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:58.390
You have no idea what you just walked into, do you?

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:06.290
No business being conducted.

00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:08.490
You've just talked to me.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:16.860
Contract services.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:18.780
How can I help you?

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.980
Bound 8-6-5-1.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:22.900
Name on contract?

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.440
Danielle Pine.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.120
Double the contract.

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.560
You've just made everything a whole lot worse.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:06.400
Those people that you're looking for are surrounding this hotel right now.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.320
Hoping somebody breaks the rules and takes the bait.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.600
I think they were hoping that somebody was going to be you.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.260
I know you just made a man, Z.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.640
Why would they be at the hotel?

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.960
They just want me dead to get to her.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:58.300
Come on!

00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:58.880
Verdammte scheisse!

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:02.920
Come on!

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:09.800
Come on!

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.240
He's moving!

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.300
I'll fight him!

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:51.840
Come on!

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.080
Dammit!

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.580
Come on!

00:54:55.180 --> 00:55:02.650
Come on!

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:05.630
Come on!

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.600
Come on!

00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:45.890
Ella, honey.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:48.170
Let's go.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.300
Why did I want her?

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.220
It's a cult.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.380
No one gets out.

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:01.680
Ever.

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.330
I think I'd help you get Ella out of here.

00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:11.830
She deserves a better life than this.

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:12.550
I can't.

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:13.590
That's not why I'm here.

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:15.090
You can come more.

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:17.470
I know what you do.

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.550
Help me protect her.

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:21.710
I'll tell you where to find her.

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.950
Please?

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:27.550
Daddy?

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:30.410
Are we going to die?

00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.430
No.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.890
Come on, baby.

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:38.550
You can trust her.

00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:20.250
Come on.

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:32.970
How many left?

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:34.330
Two and ten.

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:35.510
Fuck.

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:56.950
Come on!

00:58:59.160 --> 00:58:59.460
Good?

00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:03.430
Good.

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:06.110
Sir, there was someone else there.

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:08.350
Who?

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:09.870
A woman.

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:12.010
On the contract?

00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:13.670
I don't think so.

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:15.370
I think she might have been after Ella.

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.530
Really?

00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:19.490
Do you...

00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:22.530
Do you know who she is?

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:23.650
Not yet.

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:26.170
I left her for continental security.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.080
They started this.

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:40.640
That's bullshit.

00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:44.040
I did not break any rules.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.100
You broke my fucking jaw.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.080
You still use me.

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.680
I didn't kill anyone.

00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.860
I didn't kill anyone.

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:04.890
You're going to need to check out.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:07.130
Understood.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.200
And what are we doing today, madam?

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.380
I'd like to go hunting.

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:42.310
Have you ever done business with these people?

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:46.430
I have not.

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:49.270
But you know one of them.

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:53.130
You know more than me, I assure you.

01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:55.830
May I be frank?

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.650
I prefer to keep it that way.

01:01:04.379 --> 01:01:05.660
Are we just window shopping today?

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.480
Or would you like to make a purchase?

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.200
Depends on the merchandise.

01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:24.150
Off to you, madam.

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:45.770
So, will this be a large or small game, madam?

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:49.390
Large.

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:52.750
The V700 TTI.

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:55.390
Currently rounded 308.

01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:58.650
It's got a trigonometry point one to six octagons off.

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:04.890
And in case they want to get up close and make it personal, we've got a side R&R for the faster, dirtier stuff.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:08.250
TTI custom-built in 1821 in February.

01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:09.910
An oversized charging handle.

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:11.470
An oversized bulb release.

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:13.630
This'll take a bear's head off.

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.830
Easily.

01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:19.950
Now this is a possible favorite of mine.

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:53.490
No!

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:28.420
No!

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:28.290
Motherfuckers.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.340
All right.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.900
You didn't hear this from me.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.860
Their precise location has never been confirmed.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.800
Since anyone's ever gone looking, has also gone missing.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.820
That's bad math.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:57.140
However, whispers suggest they've been going together somewhere in these peaks, deep in the mountains past Abbasid and Felkirk.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.160
So much.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.640
It's more than I had.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.440
Thank you.

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:06.810
Sorry about your shop.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:13.550
I need a car.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.300
Did you think I would not find out that you expressly disobeyed my orders?

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.860
Then tell me who they are.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.280
I told you we do not engage with them.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.260
You risk the destruction of our family for what?

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.900
Your own selfish reasons.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.820
Return at once, or I'll have no choice.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.860
Can I get you anything?

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.300
Just a coffee.

01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:48.230
Fuck.

01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:29.250
Send somebody to the restaurant.

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:30.570
Hurry!

01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.490
No!

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.340
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:39.890
Fuck.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:41.900
This is the eye.

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.400
What is it?

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.620
The outsider has not been contained.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.860
Engage full protocol.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.860
Fuck.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:49.620
Fuck.

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:26.930
You're having a little tea party.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.000
Aren't you going to say hello to your grandfather?

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.420
Where's Daddy?

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.680
Is he okay?

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:43.700
You have no idea how worried I was.

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:44.920
All of us.

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:55.300
Your father, well, he broke our customs.

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.780
He's trying to take you away.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:17:59.980
Away from me.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.160
Away from your family.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.220
I hate you.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.600
That hate will make you stronger.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.300
I hate you.

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:15.160
Chancellor.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:21.790
We've got her.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.970
Is she dead?

01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:26.930
She's Moscow now.

01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:29.050
She had their mark.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.440
You know, I met your director once.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.420
Just many years ago in Moscow.

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.420
Not a very pleasant lady.

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.680
But we did have a respectful conversation nonetheless.

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:17.360
A shared understanding of the roles that we both play.

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:21.240
And more importantly, the roles that we don't play.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.240
The director didn't send me here.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.520
The Moscow Roma has nothing to do with this.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:28.080
Well, it does now.

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:37.330
Why are you here?

01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:41.610
If you've come for the girl, you are gravely mistaken.

01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:43.610
Ella is my granddaughter.

01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:47.670
Someday, all of this will be hers.

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.470
My son.

01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:51.030
No.

01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:54.450
He tried to deprive her of her true heritage.

01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:58.170
You put a contract on your own son?

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:04.070
You may have noticed we don't take well to outsiders meddling in our town.

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:09.450
This is where people like yourself come to live.

01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:11.820
To have real lives.

01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:14.620
To raise families.

01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:23.450
Wouldn't you like to someday have a family of your own?

01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:25.090
I had a family.

01:20:25.770 --> 01:20:26.710
I was a child.

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:29.010
Men came into my house.

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:30.330
Men from your tribe.

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:32.350
Ah, I see.

01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:35.710
This is about vengeance.

01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:37.410
They killed my father.

01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:39.250
And tried to take me.

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:43.920
Tried to take you?

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.720
Fate is a very hungry thing.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:16.780
What is it?

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.640
Ella, she wasn't working for Poyn.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:26.580
She's here because I killed her father when she was a child.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.480
She's your sister.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.300
No.

01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.000
Stop saying that.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:46.120
What are you doing?

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.420
Ella!

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:43.430
All this time I thought you were dead.

01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:46.330
What are you talking about?

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.360
You don't remember, do you?

01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:57.680
We were born here, Eve.

01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:00.240
We both were.

01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:04.560
My little sister has come home.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.240
When I was younger I used to wonder.

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:13.940
Why did they take you and not me?

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.780
Later I realized it was to leave them.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.200
I'd already taken a life.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.220
But you.

01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:29.350
I thought I could raise you with no memory of this place.

01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:30.990
Of your true home.

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:34.490
But I guess it never leaves your blood, does it?

01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:38.550
In the end, we are who we are.

01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:39.770
We are not the same.

01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:45.570
Your people killed my father.

01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:46.970
Our father, yes.

01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:48.410
For betraying us.

01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:50.850
And then our mother had to pay the price.

01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:54.250
The Chancellor was trying to save you that night.

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:58.270
He was trying to bring you back home as he would for anyone.

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:01.050
My father was trying to give me a normal life!

01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:04.210
Well, he would be very proud.

01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:07.710
You're forcing children into this life, as Roscaroma has with you.

01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:08.150
No!

01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:10.550
She gave me a choice.

01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:11.690
I chose this!

01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:12.330
Who did you?

01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:16.970
Or did fate just find another path for you?

01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:26.890
At least here, we're honest about who we are.

01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:29.550
No teaching where lies.

01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:35.250
You've got eyes on her.

01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:38.650
Covenant history.

01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:43.090
She's inside with Luna, sir.

01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.770
Talking.

01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:48.050
Take them out.

01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:49.790
Sir?

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.520
Kill them both.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.520
You heard the Chancellor.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:02.460
Blow it.

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.820
I was only nine when they told us you were dead.

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:49.740
Save your breath.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.000
I missed you.

01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:47.770
Stop!

01:26:58.940 --> 01:26:59.720
Frankie!

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:01.010
Frankie!

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.080
Don't you copy?

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:08.880
Is it done?

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.720
This isn't done until you're dead.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:36.030
Yes?

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:38.010
We have a problem.

01:27:38.610 --> 01:27:39.710
You and I.

01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:43.490
What problem might that be?

01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:48.090
That a member of your tribe has contravened a centuries-old truce.

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:51.390
The Roscaroma have no desire for a war.

01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:55.290
Especially not with you.

01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:58.570
Whether you send her or not is of no interest to me.

01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:01.850
You will accept full consequences of her actions.

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:02.850
Which are?

01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:05.130
The end of your tribe.

01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:07.510
Your students, your fucking pets.

01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:08.170
Everything.

01:28:09.490 --> 01:28:10.710
Call her off.

01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:15.390
Chancellor, she's operating against Roscaroma.

01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:18.990
I could not call her off if I tried.

01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:22.650
Then war it shall be.

01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:26.630
Perhaps an agreement could be struck.

01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:30.170
I can send someone to solve the problem.

01:28:31.650 --> 01:28:32.690
Someone capable.

01:28:33.450 --> 01:28:34.430
No more bloodshed.

01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:40.450
If you agree to this, you must also agree that your men will not engage.

01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:47.530
If come midnight she still breathes, retaliation will be inevitable and total.

01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:51.130
And if the problem is taken care of?

01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:56.090
Then I will reconsider my response.

01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:58.410
Very well.

01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:02.150
I will of course need your location.

01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:07.490
A secret I assure you will die with me.

01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:11.590
Ugh.

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.650
Madam, she is family.

01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:19.470
She has made her choice.

01:30:33.650 --> 01:30:40.730
Citizens of Houshmand, this order stays in effect until your banners ring out.

01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:44.330
As of now, you do not engage.

01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:49.830
Anyone who feels competitive or against this order will be cast out.

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:53.670
Leave the wolf to its prey.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.900
You sent you here to kill me?

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.460
That's up to you.

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.260
Or you can leave.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.540
Your choice.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.120
Do you remember me?

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:13.920
Promethean.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.000
Remember what you said to me?

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.320
You told me I could leave.

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.140
That it was my choice.

01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:28.770
It still is.

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.860
I'm not leaving.

01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:57.910
Don't have to do this.

01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:22.210
Just leave.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.660
Leave.

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:17.519
Just go.

01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:24.910
He killed my father.

01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:27.890
I know.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.800
Let me finish this.

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:50.200
Midnight.

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.040
If it isn't done.

01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:56.560
Wolves.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.740
And consequences.

01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:29.130
Let her go.

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:40.060
Attention.

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.300
Every citizen is now being called to hunt the outsider.

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.300
She wants me.

01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:57.320
And she wants Ella.

01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.960
Orders you find her.

01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:04.440
And you destroy her.

01:40:12.999 --> 01:40:14.530
Stay there. Hold!

01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:47.920
in the interest of Hallstatt's survival, it would be best to relocate you.

01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:55.300
In 200 years, no leader of Hallstatt has ever left the seat of power to seek shelter.

01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:57.780
I understand.

01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:01.540
But sir, we've also lost track of John Wick.

01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:38.400
We've got to cross here.

01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:33.310
Don't you think we've had enough?

01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:39.820
Do you really think you're going to save her from me?

01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:42.480
From all of this?

01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:50.480
Whatever happens here, nothing is going to change.

01:50:52.580 --> 01:51:00.720
The village will remain, the children will be raised, and the system will continue as it has for the last thousand years.

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:02.780
Look at you.

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:06.540
You know that you don't choose to be a killer.

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:07.740
You are chosen.

01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:11.240
Just like your sister was chosen.

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.520
Just like Ella has been chosen.

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:20.460
It is your fate, and you cannot change it.

01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:23.809
The only person you're fighting is your...

01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.670
It's okay.

01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:33.440
Done?

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:34.720
Done.

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:40.920
So, she is dead?

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:44.320
He is dead.

01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:51.660
Fine.

01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:27.360
Daddy.

01:53:35.850 --> 01:53:36.630
Hey, sweetie.

01:53:39.710 --> 01:53:40.290
Come on.

01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:42.690
Get up here.

01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.500
Room 814.

01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:55.280
I trust the talk went well?

01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:58.440
Checking in?

01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:00.380
Yes.

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:03.540
Safe haven, Miss McCall.

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:11.440
You may have cut the snake's head, but the body still lives.

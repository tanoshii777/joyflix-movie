01:03.605 --> 01:06.900
3.1415

01:07.859 --> 01:10.404
26535

01:12.197 --> 01:14.950
89793

01:17.160 --> 01:26.169
I was at home and suddenly
remembered the digits of pi.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.340
Nothing new ever happened.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.718
It had all lost its meaning.

01:34.052 --> 01:39.683
My existence was meaningless.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.542
I can't even die?

05:11.978 --> 05:16.399
LOVE AND MURDER OF SHEEP AND WOLF

05:23.490 --> 05:26.159
Someone this pretty lived right next door?

05:26.201 --> 05:27.953
I had no idea!

05:29.120 --> 05:31.748
Her hair looks so soft.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.628
Is she a student?

06:05.949 --> 06:08.410
I'll take care of you from
now on, OK?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.830
Doesn't she have any friends?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.304
She took it off!

06:34.269 --> 06:35.854
Hey...

06:36.479 --> 06:37.564
Where is she?

07:24.110 --> 07:25.236
Bro!

07:26.196 --> 07:27.447
Are you there?

07:28.740 --> 07:32.118
Bro! Bro!

08:10.448 --> 08:12.450
I can't stop!

08:22.085 --> 08:23.795
This is weird.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.256
This was on the door.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.384
I was wondering if it was
trash or something.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.928
It's a crazy world out there.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.600
Are you from this apartment complex?

08:37.642 --> 08:40.061
Yes! Yes! I moved in right there!

08:40.770 --> 08:42.814
Actually, it's been two years.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.818
So we're neighbors.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.446
Hello. I'm Miyaichi.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.031
Umm...

08:51.406 --> 08:52.532
Well...

08:52.824 --> 08:54.242
I'm Kurosu.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.244
Hello.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.168
Sorry, I was cooking.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.425
Would you like to eat with me?

09:50.215 --> 09:51.633
- Kurosu?
- Yes!

09:55.011 --> 09:58.264
You have the stretchy kind
of sweatpant strings.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.350
Sorry about that.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.395
Go have a seat.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.234
I'm sorry about a lot of stuff.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.486
Don't worry about it.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.614
I heard that food tastes better
if you eat with other people.

10:14.656 --> 10:18.159
It's been proven by
a physical mechanism.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.913
I knew you were smart.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.249
You knew?

10:24.499 --> 10:27.043
No! No! Nevermind!

10:37.262 --> 10:38.555
It's delicious.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.143
It's really delicious, but...

10:45.019 --> 10:46.020
But?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.439
Could I have some more?

10:52.277 --> 10:53.570
Go ahead.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.379
She told me to come again.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.214
It's like a dream!

11:37.030 --> 11:38.448
I'm glad.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.050
Good night.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.123
Umm...

12:30.124 --> 12:32.460
It may be too late to ask...

12:33.378 --> 12:36.506
Why are you with me, Miyaichi-san?

12:39.550 --> 12:41.261
What's wrong?

12:41.636 --> 12:44.097
I'll just come right out and say it:

12:45.139 --> 12:48.142
I think I'm finished as a person.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.646
You probably already noticed...

12:51.688 --> 12:55.108
I don't do anything.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.943
I quit prep school.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.904
I don't work.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.575
You're eating dinner with me.

13:06.577 --> 13:12.125
But don't you ask yourself why?

13:13.084 --> 13:16.629
How long is this guy going to eat
with me?

13:16.671 --> 13:18.506
You ask yourself that, right?

13:24.887 --> 13:26.806
I wonder...

13:31.436 --> 13:33.021
Also...

13:33.813 --> 13:36.232
This is going to end some day, right?

13:37.066 --> 13:41.738
Didn't you hear a snap and
a crash the other day?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.621
You know what?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.759
If we connect so well...

14:07.221 --> 14:08.681
Isn't that good?

14:28.701 --> 14:31.746
I can't! I can't!
It's a crime!

14:32.288 --> 14:34.582
Let's just stop this!

15:03.611 --> 15:08.783
I says in the contract that
I can't stick thumbtacks into the walls.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.580
Yeah, that's not good.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.640
Huh?

15:32.974 --> 15:34.308
Who is that?

15:34.976 --> 15:37.728
No way! Her boyfriend?

15:41.107 --> 15:43.234
Hey! Cut the bullshit!

16:41.626 --> 16:43.211
What was that?

17:03.689 --> 17:06.901
She had a knife or something.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.530
Then she wrapped her hands
around him...

17:13.282 --> 17:15.116
No! No! No!

17:15.117 --> 17:17.954
No way! Miyaichi wouldn't...

17:36.222 --> 17:38.265
Kurosu-kun?

17:38.266 --> 17:39.684
Are you there?

17:47.858 --> 17:50.820
I want to eat in your room
every now and then.

18:17.972 --> 18:22.643
You asked me a question
the other day.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.729
Yeah?

18:25.271 --> 18:28.649
You asked me why someone like you?

18:29.317 --> 18:33.154
You don't get anxious, Kurosu-kun?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.907
Do you ever wonder if you're
abnormal?

18:39.243 --> 18:43.914
If you're always alone, you start
comparing yourself to other people.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.586
You want to confirm that
you're normal.

18:51.964 --> 18:57.178
But on the other hand,
you just want to be yourself.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.642
The reason I eat with you...

19:03.309 --> 19:08.147
is to find out if I'm normal
or not.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.070
We need a good balance, Kurosu-kun.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.524
It was just a hallucination
after all!

19:58.614 --> 20:00.407
I'm going home, Miyaichi.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.410
Yeah, see you later.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.371
A friend?

20:30.896 --> 20:33.149
I can see your strings.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.818
Kurosu!

21:06.724 --> 21:08.434
Morning, Kurosu-kun!

21:15.149 --> 21:16.692
Good morning!

21:17.193 --> 21:19.320
Are you going to university?

21:20.029 --> 21:21.363
That's right.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.823
And you?

21:23.741 --> 21:26.744
I'm just going to the
wash my clothes.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.206
You can use my washing machine.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.249
That's a bit much...

21:32.291 --> 21:35.586
Then let's eat together
in your room again!

21:37.338 --> 21:38.255
Sure!

21:38.256 --> 21:41.592
Well, I'm off to the station!

21:41.634 --> 21:43.052
See you later!

22:06.325 --> 22:07.952
There's no way!

22:07.993 --> 22:10.079
Miyaichi is a good person.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.039
And she's cute!

22:13.123 --> 22:15.501
But why am I doing this?

22:47.992 --> 22:49.410
Again?

22:49.451 --> 22:51.036
What are you doing?

23:11.515 --> 23:12.892
It wasn't a hallucination!

23:16.353 --> 23:18.105
She killed him!

24:31.345 --> 24:34.014
Did you see me kill him?

24:35.808 --> 24:36.934
Sorry...

24:39.395 --> 24:40.771
Since when?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.233
Not that long ago.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.030
How amusing...

24:51.865 --> 24:54.493
And you still ate dinner with me?

24:56.537 --> 24:57.830
But...

25:11.844 --> 25:13.887
Do you want me to kill you?

25:18.475 --> 25:22.062
I tried to kill myself.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.441
But I didn't die.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.403
Then I discovered that peephole...

25:31.655 --> 25:34.158
and I fell in love with you.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.787
That was better than dying.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.624
And...

25:43.625 --> 25:45.627
even if I ran away now...

25:46.837 --> 25:49.965
I don't know how I would
live afterwards.

26:22.331 --> 26:25.000
You sure are interesting.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.213
You're very interesting!

26:40.808 --> 26:46.063
Tell me how you're felling
at this very moment.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.781
This moment?

26:57.616 --> 27:00.285
Nothing but death awaits you.

27:04.206 --> 27:07.251
What do you feel

27:10.879 --> 27:12.756
In the depths of my heart?

27:20.556 --> 27:24.017
I want to date you...

27:28.230 --> 27:30.983
Miyaichi-san.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.829
That's fine!

27:46.331 --> 27:47.624
Right.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.837
Then...

28:07.311 --> 28:11.732
Fresh blood doesn't taste
like iron.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.818
It tastes like salt.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.824
Not yet. I'll kill you!

28:26.663 --> 28:30.626
Spy on me!

29:07.496 --> 29:12.376
Brother, you have to contact me!

29:12.417 --> 29:15.002
Mom and dad are worried
about you!

29:15.003 --> 29:17.714
You don't have to come here.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.799
I'll show up next time.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.928
You have to!

29:29.184 --> 29:30.352
Thank you.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.234
Hello!

29:38.235 --> 29:40.070
Likewise!

29:41.613 --> 29:43.824
- Hello!
- Hello!

29:47.452 --> 29:48.620
Later!

29:51.331 --> 29:53.458
You sure are pretty!

30:09.308 --> 30:11.058
You can see it!

30:11.059 --> 30:13.937
I'm completely exposed.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.938
Sorry.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.233
I'll patch it up right away.

30:18.275 --> 30:19.818
It's fine!

30:19.860 --> 30:22.988
We're dating, after all.
You're my little observer.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.368
Hey...

30:28.410 --> 30:32.539
Am I really dating you?

30:34.249 --> 30:37.169
Yeah, we're dating!

30:39.254 --> 30:40.714
Then...

30:41.214 --> 30:43.842
Which part of me do you...

30:45.719 --> 30:49.139
What about you?
Which part of me do you like?

30:52.726 --> 30:54.227
Everything.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.733
Wow, now I'm embarrassed!

31:01.985 --> 31:04.571
I guess I need to get a job first, huh?

31:04.613 --> 31:06.198
Ouch!

31:09.159 --> 31:11.078
That'll be 300 yen.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.219
You won't make money that way.

31:27.260 --> 31:29.888
There's zero merit in working
at a convenience store, right?

31:29.930 --> 31:33.850
Well, at least I finally got a job.

31:34.184 --> 31:35.644
Is that so?

32:10.929 --> 32:14.182
- Welcome back!
- I'm home.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.525
Thank you for your hard work.

32:23.567 --> 32:26.570
Wouldn't it be better if we just
talked when we're in the same room?

32:26.611 --> 32:29.448
But it's late at night!

32:31.658 --> 32:34.995
I was thinking about what
a boyfriend is.

32:36.037 --> 32:39.040
This is my first time dating someone,
after all!

32:41.418 --> 32:44.588
You just imagined something,
didn't you?

32:44.629 --> 32:46.047
No! No!

32:48.258 --> 32:53.096
I want you to accompany me tomorrow.

32:53.722 --> 32:56.683
So, in other words, you want
us to go on a date?

32:56.725 --> 32:59.311
Well, there's a problem...

32:59.811 --> 33:02.147
It would be impossible to
suddenly ask for a day off, right?

33:02.189 --> 33:03.482
No!

33:03.982 --> 33:08.737
There's zero merit in working
at a convenience store, right?

33:21.625 --> 33:25.127
Sorry! The one in the lab is broken.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.547
No! This is nothing!

33:36.056 --> 33:38.225
What's wrong, Kurosu-kun?

33:39.726 --> 33:44.439
I'm quite self-conscious and
I just got fired.

33:44.481 --> 33:48.401
Just being at the university
is triggering my complex.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.030
Hello, Miyaichi-san!

33:56.034 --> 33:57.494
Who is that?

33:58.745 --> 34:01.206
- My boyfriend.
- Huh?

34:03.500 --> 34:04.876
Boyfriend?

34:05.544 --> 34:09.130
Boyfriend? Boyfriend?

34:24.771 --> 34:27.566
This is my first time dating,
after all.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.820
Thanks for today!

34:32.862 --> 34:34.781
You really helped me out!

34:41.121 --> 34:42.747
What's wrong?

34:43.790 --> 34:47.752
I wonder if I should retake the exam.

34:52.507 --> 34:57.012
I'll try to get in here next yearn and
try to get rid of the bugs around you!

34:57.053 --> 34:57.971
Bugs?

34:59.806 --> 35:02.684
You're more positive than I thought!

35:03.768 --> 35:07.272
I don't want to imagine a future
where we aren't together.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.151
I'll become a suitable man for you!

35:14.446 --> 35:16.072
Suitable?

35:24.539 --> 35:27.542
I'm a murderer.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.839
And I'm still active.

35:33.298 --> 35:36.593
Actually, I've been doing this
for a while now.

35:43.016 --> 35:44.434
So...

35:45.560 --> 35:47.062
Until when?

35:53.610 --> 35:55.570
Forever?

35:57.238 --> 35:58.990
Are you hungry?

35:59.616 --> 36:00.742
Yes!

36:00.784 --> 36:02.786
Then let's go somewhere!

36:08.917 --> 36:10.335
What is it?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.203
Are you OK?

36:45.537 --> 36:47.122
Did you get blood on you?

36:55.171 --> 36:58.425
Miyaichi, you're outside!

36:59.968 --> 37:02.887
Outside or inside,
murder is murder!

37:03.638 --> 37:06.433
Why do you always do
it in front of me?

37:06.850 --> 37:08.935
We're lovers, aren't we?

37:09.769 --> 37:12.563
So it's a sign of affection?

37:12.564 --> 37:17.485
What did those people ever
do to you?

37:17.527 --> 37:19.404
They haven't done anything.

37:19.446 --> 37:25.034
So you just kill anyone,
without discrimination?

37:26.745 --> 37:29.539
I decide according to some rules.

37:31.374 --> 37:35.086
This is Mazoko!

37:36.671 --> 37:40.842
Criminals have been lurking
around here recently.

37:40.884 --> 37:43.428
I made a list and am killing
them off.

37:49.768 --> 37:53.688
Does that make you an
ally of justice?

37:55.857 --> 37:57.400
You think so?

38:02.655 --> 38:04.157
Is that how you see it?

38:05.325 --> 38:06.743
Uh, nope.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.579
It'd be nice if that were true...

38:16.586 --> 38:20.381
No matter the reason, killing
people is no good, right?

38:35.605 --> 38:38.107
There's no reports at all!

38:40.193 --> 38:42.778
- Help me out here!
- Huh?

38:42.779 --> 38:43.988
I'm tired.

38:44.030 --> 38:47.075
Sorry!

38:47.116 --> 38:50.119
Sorry! Sorry!

39:04.884 --> 39:07.762
- Hello.
- Hello.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.431
Do you like cats?

39:12.100 --> 39:14.018
I do.

39:14.435 --> 39:19.315
If you called me a cat person,
I wouldn't deny it.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.735
- Cats are cute, huh?
- Right?

39:23.653 --> 39:25.530
They're cute.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.963
She keeps slicing people up.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.845
But she sure is cute.

39:55.184 --> 39:57.729
- Are you done with work?
- Yes.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.781
Can I eat this?

40:10.241 --> 40:11.659
Go ahead.

40:13.912 --> 40:19.292
There was one little puppy in the bag.

40:20.001 --> 40:24.464
Then, when you hit the bag,
two puppies came out.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.216
Here.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.179
- Thanks.
- No problem.

41:12.679 --> 41:15.890
I'm finally going to get a phone.

41:19.686 --> 41:21.312
Ah, welcome!

41:26.818 --> 41:29.237
Also, can you get me some
<i>kara-age</i> and an American hot dog?

41:29.278 --> 41:30.571
Yes.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.284
Huh?

41:36.285 --> 41:38.705
You're from my brother's
apartment complex!

41:38.746 --> 41:39.747
Huh?

41:41.708 --> 41:43.084
On the first floor?

41:43.126 --> 41:45.420
I'm Kawasaki's little sister, Haruko!

41:45.461 --> 41:47.295
Thanks for taking care of
my older brother.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.339
Thank you, too. It was yummy!

41:49.340 --> 41:50.216
Huh?

41:53.886 --> 41:56.097
You don't have to pay for
the hot snacks.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.265
- No, I can't do that!
- It's fine!

41:58.266 --> 42:00.685
You guys have been supporting me.

42:01.644 --> 42:03.563
Then I'll accept your offer.

42:03.604 --> 42:04.480
Good.

42:19.412 --> 42:21.456
It's so bright!

42:23.249 --> 42:24.959
<i>I'm home!</i>

42:28.838 --> 42:30.048
Huh?

42:38.264 --> 42:41.809
<i>Stay in your room at 22:00 tonight.</i>

42:43.394 --> 42:45.021
This is...

43:14.133 --> 43:15.718
<i>Stay in your room at 22:00 tonight.</i>

43:20.556 --> 43:22.266
Kawasaki-sen?

43:30.233 --> 43:31.317
Why?

43:34.987 --> 43:37.114
Miyaichi-san! You can't!

43:37.115 --> 43:38.741
Stop it!

43:42.370 --> 43:45.039
Don't raise your voice like that!

43:45.998 --> 43:47.541
What if I get caught?

43:47.542 --> 43:50.211
Murder is a crime, Miyaichi-san!

43:50.253 --> 43:52.380
What did Kawasaki-sen do?

43:54.132 --> 43:56.467
Make sure you get a good look!

44:12.483 --> 44:13.651
Why?

44:26.998 --> 44:28.249
Why?

45:11.375 --> 45:12.668
It's her...

45:37.151 --> 45:38.819
For crying out loud...

45:38.861 --> 45:41.739
What do you see in a guy like this?

45:41.781 --> 45:44.408
Are you brave or just stupid?

45:51.624 --> 45:53.459
Who are you?

45:53.751 --> 45:55.378
What are you doing here?

45:57.046 --> 45:59.381
Miyaichi cut his carotid artery.

45:59.382 --> 46:01.759
She does that beautifully.

46:02.885 --> 46:05.595
That's an interesting definition
of "beautiful".

46:05.596 --> 46:07.848
Anyway, please answer me!

46:08.432 --> 46:10.393
I'm Reina Enmeiji.

46:10.434 --> 46:13.145
I'm here to collect the body
and clean up the site.

46:15.564 --> 46:17.400
Collect the corpse?

46:18.234 --> 46:22.655
He's in bad shape already,
so feel free to chop him up.

46:31.622 --> 46:37.628
Don't you think it's odd that
Miyaichi hasn't been caught yet?

46:37.962 --> 46:39.130
Huh?

46:41.257 --> 46:43.968
I guess I think it's strange...

46:44.885 --> 46:48.889
You're kind of slow, aren't you?

46:49.890 --> 46:54.812
There's plenty of people
who have a need for fresh corpses.

46:55.938 --> 46:58.232
Including me.

47:00.401 --> 47:03.654
The corpses that are produced
by Miyaichi have no competitive rate.

47:06.157 --> 47:07.867
Miyaichi-san...

47:07.908 --> 47:09.368
Where is she?

47:09.410 --> 47:11.287
I think she went to get
something to eat.

47:11.329 --> 47:12.997
She gets hungry after she kills.

47:13.039 --> 47:14.498
Later!

47:14.540 --> 47:16.667
Hey! Hold on!

47:19.128 --> 47:24.425
Why did Miyaichi-san kill
Kawasaki?

47:25.593 --> 47:27.178
Well...

47:27.219 --> 47:29.680
Seeing is believing.

48:46.966 --> 48:51.470
He killed and dissected
the neighborhood cats.

48:51.512 --> 48:54.974
If you asked him how he did
it, he'd go into great detail.

48:56.016 --> 48:57.685
Are you jealous?

49:01.313 --> 49:02.730
Hey...

49:02.731 --> 49:05.276
Why are you so shocked?

49:05.734 --> 49:08.320
You were going to get killed
just like that.

49:10.573 --> 49:14.493
It's impossible for Miyaichi to interact
with people for any other purpose.

49:15.578 --> 49:17.663
No exceptions.

49:27.590 --> 49:29.425
Kurosu-kun?

50:13.886 --> 50:15.679
That was dangerous!

50:15.721 --> 50:18.097
If I slipped, I'd have fallen off!

50:18.098 --> 50:20.058
Did you get here from the veranda?

50:20.059 --> 50:20.851
Yes.

50:20.852 --> 50:23.687
I mean, you wouldn't open your door!

50:23.729 --> 50:25.022
Well...

50:25.064 --> 50:27.107
I'm not feeling well.

50:32.446 --> 50:34.573
Then let me warm you up.

50:35.908 --> 50:38.536
Miyaichi, you're too close!

50:39.745 --> 50:42.831
It's fine! We're lovers!

50:42.873 --> 50:44.458
That's true.

50:46.335 --> 50:48.087
You're right, but...

50:50.464 --> 50:52.800
Your enunciation sucks!

50:52.841 --> 50:55.886
My tongue and teeth make
my words crisp!

50:57.888 --> 50:59.640
Also...

51:00.307 --> 51:02.725
Let me tell you something
interesting!

51:02.726 --> 51:04.353
Don't.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.358
Murdering people is bad, right?

51:11.986 --> 51:14.780
I don't understand you when
you're being so abstract.

51:21.537 --> 51:23.706
I'll tell it to you straight!

51:24.206 --> 51:27.042
Murdering people is no good, right?

51:30.045 --> 51:32.047
Cats are cute, right?

51:32.089 --> 51:36.134
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- Is this because I killed someone you knew?

51:36.135 --> 51:37.428
No...

51:38.387 --> 51:40.973
I don't feel pity for Kawasaki.

51:41.473 --> 51:42.724
It's just...

51:42.725 --> 51:44.184
Wait...

51:45.603 --> 51:49.440
Are there people who can be killed
and some who can't?

51:50.566 --> 51:51.859
No...

51:52.276 --> 51:53.444
That's...

51:53.485 --> 51:55.446
Who makes that decision?

51:55.988 --> 51:57.697
Like I said...

51:57.698 --> 52:00.075
There needs to be lawfulness...

52:00.117 --> 52:04.204
As time passes, a country's
laws change, right?

52:04.246 --> 52:06.332
There is no lawfulness.

52:10.377 --> 52:11.712
I...

52:14.798 --> 52:16.508
didn't want to see it.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.605
Hey, Miyaichi-san...

52:32.274 --> 52:33.609
What?

52:35.110 --> 52:37.905
I think you should go
through the front door.

53:02.262 --> 53:05.057
My room is locked!

53:20.322 --> 53:22.574
I still like her...

53:28.747 --> 53:30.207
Kurosu-san!

53:33.293 --> 53:34.878
Hello.

53:36.130 --> 53:38.464
You're Haruko-chan, right?

53:38.465 --> 53:39.508
Hello.

53:40.634 --> 53:41.885
Hey!

53:42.845 --> 53:45.848
How has my brother been?

53:49.059 --> 53:52.604
I wonder if he's going to university
or not.

53:54.314 --> 53:56.108
About that...

53:56.150 --> 54:00.571
- I wonder...
- He hasn't come home at all.

54:00.612 --> 54:03.157
I came to see him.

54:03.198 --> 54:06.368
Luckily, Wednesday is my day off.

54:14.752 --> 54:16.420
Miyaichi-san!

54:18.589 --> 54:20.257
Who is that?

54:21.300 --> 54:23.885
I'm Haruko Kawasaki.

54:23.886 --> 54:26.054
My older brother lives here.

54:29.975 --> 54:31.685
I see.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.190
Do you want to wait for him
at my place?

54:36.231 --> 54:38.024
- Can I?
- No, you can't!

54:38.025 --> 54:41.153
You have to go out
and run errands, rights?

54:41.195 --> 54:42.738
I do?

54:42.780 --> 54:47.576
Anyway, as soon as I see
Kawasaki, I'll let you know.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.912
OK?

54:49.953 --> 54:52.956
Well, thank you.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.801
Were you going to kill her?

55:09.640 --> 55:11.391
How scary!

55:14.144 --> 55:17.940
She'll definitely come back
next Wednesday!

55:18.607 --> 55:21.360
She'll definitely find out!

55:21.819 --> 55:23.278
That's OK!

55:23.320 --> 55:25.696
He disappeared without a trace.

55:25.697 --> 55:27.866
There you go...

55:30.702 --> 55:33.455
Well, the food's going to get cold!

55:33.497 --> 55:35.207
Thanks for the food!

55:39.294 --> 55:41.755
You're really not going to kill her?

55:43.507 --> 55:45.551
I already told you...

55:45.592 --> 55:47.636
I have rules!

55:48.220 --> 55:52.641
If I start killing people like that,
it puts my character in question.

55:53.725 --> 55:56.019
A murderer's character?

56:00.315 --> 56:05.696
<i>- This is Haruko! I sent you a message. - This is Kurosu. Hello.
- It's about my brother. Can we talk tomorrow over some tea?</i>

56:26.758 --> 56:28.427
Reina-san?

56:29.261 --> 56:30.429
Hello.

56:30.846 --> 56:33.806
You smell like a corpse.

56:33.807 --> 56:35.392
I thought you were a zombie.

56:35.434 --> 56:36.851
I'm alive!

56:36.852 --> 56:38.395
Not that I really want to be.

56:38.437 --> 56:41.147
Is there nothing you can
be enthusiastic about?

56:41.148 --> 56:42.816
Become suitable for Miyaichi!

56:42.858 --> 56:47.279
Because of Miyaichi's line of work,
Kawasaki's sister is looking for him!

56:47.321 --> 56:49.239
There's no way she'll find
someone who's dead.

56:49.281 --> 56:50.657
I know that!

56:50.699 --> 56:52.117
Don't get so worked up!

56:54.119 --> 56:58.248
If you're prepared to give up
your own life...

56:58.290 --> 56:59.917
I'll help you out.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.502
Pardon?

57:02.753 --> 57:07.215
You got a nice ass on you,
don't you?

57:09.343 --> 57:13.305
As a person you're useless,
but you'll make a good corpse.

57:20.354 --> 57:22.898
You went to the police?!

57:26.777 --> 57:27.819
Yes.

57:27.861 --> 57:32.407
My parents told me that he
hasn't come home in a long time.

57:35.452 --> 57:37.162
So you filed a missing persons
report?

57:37.204 --> 57:39.872
No, I retracted it.

57:39.873 --> 57:43.669
I think he might have gone
on a trip or something.

57:43.710 --> 57:46.046
I really over-reacted!

57:47.005 --> 57:48.840
I think so too.

57:48.882 --> 57:52.426
I want to ask you for
a favor.

57:52.427 --> 57:57.516
Can you accompany me when
I speak to the landlord?

57:58.100 --> 58:00.686
What? Are you OK?

58:00.727 --> 58:02.396
I'm OK!

58:03.647 --> 58:05.440
But...

58:05.482 --> 58:07.317
That's a bit...

58:07.359 --> 58:10.487
I'm scared to go by myself.

58:10.529 --> 58:11.738
Please!

58:17.077 --> 58:19.830
What if he's dead in there
or something?

58:19.871 --> 58:21.915
There's no way he's dead!

58:21.957 --> 58:23.458
Right, Kurosu?

58:23.500 --> 58:24.583
Right.

58:24.584 --> 58:27.337
But he might not be in there...

58:30.007 --> 58:31.800
I'm coming in!

58:33.719 --> 58:35.762
Looks like he's out.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.180
Geez!

58:37.222 --> 58:40.017
What is he up to?

58:46.356 --> 58:49.401
He's got a pretty cool room!

58:53.280 --> 58:54.656
Huh?

58:54.698 --> 58:55.741
Over here!

58:56.908 --> 58:59.077
Looks like he went somewhere.

59:04.166 --> 59:07.377
I didn't want to say this, but...

59:08.211 --> 59:11.298
looks like he didn't want anyone
to interfere.

59:14.676 --> 59:17.471
Your brother's room was neat, huh?

59:18.096 --> 59:19.598
You think so?

59:21.767 --> 59:24.102
Did he go alone?

59:24.686 --> 59:28.690
I don't really know, but maybe
he's job-hunting.

59:30.776 --> 59:33.737
Well, I'm relieved.

59:33.779 --> 59:35.864
Sorry for making you tag along!

59:35.906 --> 59:38.157
Not at all! Don't worry about it!

59:38.158 --> 59:40.326
If something happens, let me know.

59:40.327 --> 59:44.581
No, I can't do that!
I'd piss your girlfriend off!

59:44.623 --> 59:45.706
Pardon?

59:45.707 --> 59:48.502
She's your girlfriend, right?

59:48.543 --> 59:51.797
Having a lover next door
seems nice!

59:51.838 --> 59:54.215
Yeah, I wonder...

59:54.216 --> 59:59.054
We're dating but, as a person,
she's kind of twisted.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.264
I don't even really know her.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:05.936
You're pretty deep, Kurosu!

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:08.772
No, I'm stupid.

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:12.067
I'm in way over my head.

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:25.288
That was a good day!
Even if nothing happened!

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:08.957
Miyaichi-san...

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:14.379
Who did you see today?

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:16.589
Huh?

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.134
I'm in university, I can see
whoever I want.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:22.012
There it is!
You're hiding something!

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:26.516
Aren't you secretly preparing
to dump me?

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:34.524
What about you?

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:38.320
Why are you so smitten
with that girl with glasses?

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:42.073
No, that's...

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:45.285
It seems that Reina covered it
up, but...

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:48.079
I told you to just leave it alone!

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:53.251
So Reina-san did that...

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:56.379
How unexpected...

01:01:57.422 --> 01:02:00.300
She told me it was a bad
idea to connect with people.

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.844
And then I ended up connecting
with someone.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:05.138
I'm surprised as well!

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.015
What's with that dreadlocked dude?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.476
He had his arms around you
and you were smiling!

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:12.354
- Very sketchy!
- How about you?

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.563
You're practically drooling
if you're around her!

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:17.317
Shouldn't you just end things with her?

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:25.533
It wasn't for her sake!

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.078
I was thinking about you!

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.294
Not yet.

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:20.839
I'll kill you.

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:42.110
Weren't you about to drop that?

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:49.534
Welcome!

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:51.911
She's here.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:05.550
This woman sure has some guts!

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:07.844
I came here to reject the offer
from the other day.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.681
Wait! Wait!

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:19.481
I...

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:23.735
was great friends with him!

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:25.653
What are you doing?

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.785
I feel the same way, but we're
going to be comrades from now on.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:35.497
I came here to refuse you!

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.582
Where are you going?

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:41.503
You're just going to keep
on killing, right?

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:44.047
And you have some useful tools,
don't you?

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.383
The clean-up crew.

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:50.386
I don't really know...

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:51.763
Hey...

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:56.059
Don't work with the police.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:05:00.270
You can't wipe us out.

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:08.154
Lately, we have those bastards
coming after us, one after the other!

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:13.284
Honestly, it's going to be impossible
with just us.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:17.956
That's where you and your
clean-up crew come in.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:24.546
You can kill them without any problem,
just like you did with Kuu-chan.

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:29.300
It's impossible.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:30.844
Killing people.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.179
I'll be taking my leave.

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.559
It was Korosu, right?

01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:43.022
Is that neighbor your boyfriend?

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:45.859
Your pet? Preserved food?

01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:49.404
I'll take him out.

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:54.117
Good job!

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:05.378
Huh? Miyaichi-san?

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:09.257
You came to pick me up?

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.593
No, just a coincidence.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:14.554
With such perfect timing?

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.890
You were waiting for me,
weren't you?

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:20.058
Then let's leave it at that.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.479
No, no! This is odd!

01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:24.814
It's no like you!

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:27.442
What should we eat tomorrow evening?

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.903
Anything is fine.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.699
Huh? Haruko—chan?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:38.620
Hello. Sorry for coming
by so suddenly.

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:50.172
I just got this from Bangkok.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.800
It says to tell you all about it.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:59.349
This is really amazing...

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.935
It's not amazing at all!

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:05.021
My parents asked me what
he's doing!

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:10.443
It would be nice if he came
back home safely.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:11.819
Miyaichi-san!

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.988
But that's right!

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:17.491
He just stopped coming home...

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.911
and he won't answer me...

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.580
He won't answer...

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:25.083
Haruko-chan?

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.251
Huh?

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:28.378
Sorry...

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:30.088
Huh?

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:35.885
Haruko-chan?

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:39.013
Haruko-chan! Haruko-chan!

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.600
Haruko-chan!

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:55.363
What are you doing?

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:58.700
- I'm getting ready.
- Ready for what?

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:01.077
Did she do something?

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.581
Wait! Why?

01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:07.625
Why?

01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:11.379
You said you wouldn't kill
just to keep someone quiet!

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:13.214
You said that they'd question
your character!

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:15.883
I make my own rules.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:29.981
If you just slaughter people
like this...

01:08:30.815 --> 01:08:32.817
the police will start moving in.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:38.406
I don't want you to be caught!

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:42.660
I'll be fine if she goes to Bangkok
as well.

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:45.079
Even if you don't get caught...

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:49.375
Killing people is dangerous, right?

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:54.130
You might even be killed!

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:02.096
That's why...

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.099
you shouldn't kill anymore.

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:15.610
In that case, I'll kill you.

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:22.909
All I have to do is slice your
artery and have you bleed out!

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:30.083
- You can't do that!
- It's really easy!

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:35.588
But you can't do it!

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:51.479
That's not true!

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:21.217
You're awake!

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:28.516
I sure did it!

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.935
I passed out in someone else's home!

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:34.147
You must have been tired!

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:36.816
Here!

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:41.946
I'm really sorry!

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:43.905
Not at all! Not at all!

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.826
I'll take you to the train station
before it gets dark.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.918
If you're that nice to me...

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:59.589
I won't know what to do.

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.549
No...

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.552
I'm not really being nice.

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:10.600
What do you like about Miyaichi-san?

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.896
What do I like?

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:18.107
Everything!

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:22.320
I like you, Kurosu-san!

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:27.116
Sorry! Sorry!

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:30.620
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:43.716
Am I no good?

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:00.066
Reina-san!

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:06.572
Pardon me.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.708
Why is she alive?

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:33.432
This is the first time she hasn't killed
someone I was after.

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:41.816
Don't confuse Miyaichi!

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:50.073
Miyaichi won't connect with you
anyway.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:52.869
A wolf will always be a wolf.

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:57.039
And even a sheep without a flock
is still just a sheep.

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:17.268
I'm sorry about the other day.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.937
I don't have all the free time
in the world, OK?

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:24.901
Why are you just sucking on that thing?

01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:30.865
It's a Papico!

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:32.658
Is it tasty?

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.747
It's super tasty!

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:39.832
Want some?

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:43.794
No, saliva is mixed with people's
half-eaten food.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:46.964
That's OK!

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.758
It's a set of two!

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:52.261
They're connected like this.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:58.726
Who you kill and who you
let live is up to you.

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:01.395
However...

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.650
Once you start to waver,
the corpses become unclean.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.652
I won't collect them.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.329
I'm sorry about the other day.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.875
The same goes for me.

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:24.919
But...

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:27.254
I'm serious!

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:35.054
I was worried about your brother...

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:37.556
I wanted to help you out.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:43.646
You said it, didn't you?

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:46.774
That Miyaichi-san doesn't
suit you at all.

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:49.443
No, no, no!
That's not what I meant.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:53.072
- I'd be suitable for you!
- No, no, no!

01:14:57.535 --> 01:15:01.914
You're just getting dragged around.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:05.084
Does she even love you?

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.337
Dragging me around?

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:17.096
She's someone who won't
change for you.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:33.154
I'll be waiting for you at this
coffee shop at 8 am. tomorrow.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:39.952
Could you think about me for
a bit until then?

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:04.060
Is she a person who won't change?

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:13.694
Huh? Reina-sen?

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:33.089
I see. You thought you
were being kidnapped.

01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:35.091
Yes.

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:38.636
But I'm glad I was wrong.
I'm really glad!

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:40.596
Good for you!

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:43.307
Then Miyaichi can help us out,
right?

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.230
She won't do that.

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:54.193
Then I'll go to the police
and report that she killed my friend.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.822
- You can go now.
- Hold on!

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.824
She'll help us out?

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:01.699
She won't.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.203
- I'll go to the police!
- Hold on, I said!

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:07.164
Why are you so determined?

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:10.166
Even if she killed another 45 people,
it wouldn't change anything.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.710
She's a murderer.

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:14.421
That's not true!

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.882
Those are two different things!

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.719
What's different about getting killed?

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:23.722
Pet boy?

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:18.861
You can't, Miyaichi-san.

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:23.615
- I can't what?
- Just leave them alone.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:26.951
- Don't turn them into corpses.
- Then what should I do?

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:28.495
Nothing.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:34.960
Kurosu, they'll kill you!

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.714
That's preferable to you killing people.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.976
What have you been seeing
from here?

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.104
You.

01:18:55.105 --> 01:18:56.982
That's not it.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.819
What did you see me do?

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:04.990
Killing...

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:09.161
- ...people.
- That's right.

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:13.749
I murder people.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:18.295
- I'll keep doing that.
- But you didn't kill Haruko-chan!

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.423
You can stop if you want to!

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:25.510
- There's no way I can stop.
- I'll stop you!

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:27.680
Murdering people is what I do.

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:29.765
If I don't murder, I'm no
longer myself.

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:31.850
There is a Miyaichi-san that
doesn't murder!

01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:33.644
You can have that future!

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:43.612
I like you. Miyaichi-san.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:49.118
I like you so much I could die!

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:57.960
I like you to the point where
I wouldn't care if I died!

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.009
Kurosu-kun...

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:07.469
You don't understand me.

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:13.309
- You...
- I do know you!

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.894
You said that you peeped
on me, didn't you?

01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:25.237
I wanted you do see the inside
of me more and more.

01:20:27.948 --> 01:20:29.533
I've been watching you!

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:36.623
You fell in love with a murderer
like me.

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:43.589
But you refuse to accept that
I will continue to kill people.

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:55.768
The future you wish for
has a lot more tranquility.

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:01.523
I don't think I'm necessary
for that kind of future.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:10.783
<i>You're
wrong'</i>

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.078
If you're not with me...

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:16.789
It can't be helped that
I have to kill.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:21.126
If you follow those feelings,
you'll get trapped.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.883
I decide the rules by which I kill.

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:33.931
Miyaichi-san!

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:42.981
Cover up that peephole already!

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:33.240
Perfect timing.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.868
I'll have you stuffed after
you're dead.

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:37.786
What are you doing?

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:39.204
Buying stuff.

01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:42.124
Miyaichi said these were super yummy.

01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:53.093
Miyaichi asked me for a favor.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:55.512
She wants to do a big clean-up.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:02.060
Well, there's a lot of people
who'd be grateful for it.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.314
There are way too many
for just two people.

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:06.899
It's dangerous!

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.444
But...

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:13.655
I can't do anything.

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:18.327
Miyaichi-san will kill people.

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:22.664
I can't accept that.

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:27.878
I can't do anything.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:34.301
Well, you weren't connected
with her in the first place.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:36.637
It's impossible to break
your connection.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.288
That's not right...

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:36.131
Peep on me, Kurosu—kun!

01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:07.663
This isn't right!

01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:31.353
Shit!

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:38.694
Hello. Kurosu—san?

01:26:38.735 --> 01:26:40.695
Sorry, Haruko-chan!

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:42.823
I have to go somewhere!

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:46.951
Miyaichi-san won't change herself.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:49.496
She's just dragging me around.

01:26:50.163 --> 01:26:51.998
She doesn't need me!

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:56.044
But I need her!

01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:09.891
Don't make Miyaichi-san sad!

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:17.816
Make her stop killing right now!

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:23.739
Right now!

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:47.596
You've gone crazy.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:25.926
All you have to do is slice their
arteries and have them bleed out!

01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:32.599
All you have to do is slice their
arteries and have them bleed out!

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.309
You're grossing me out.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:38.313
Is this the first time Miyaichi
doesn't need him?

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:45.028
Look, all you have to do
is cut the artery.

01:28:47.614 --> 01:28:49.449
Die, you bastard!

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.122
Why are you here?

01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:27.881
Miyaichi-san...

01:32:49.022 --> 01:32:51.566
What were you doing?

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:55.278
You were going to get yourself
killed!

01:32:55.737 --> 01:33:00.366
Didn't these guys make
you kill for them?

01:33:02.285 --> 01:33:05.580
I kill people according to
my own rules.

01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:08.374
I don't need people telling me to.

01:33:09.375 --> 01:33:13.004
Then, who did you kill earlier?

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:19.260
That was one of their gang members.

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:23.306
Don't worry, he has been disposed of.

01:33:27.018 --> 01:33:29.395
You sure are amazing.

01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:39.864
But you weren't smiling when
you did it.

01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:42.909
Right.

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:47.288
It wasn't fun at all.

01:33:48.414 --> 01:33:52.210
Sou you're done killing?

01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:57.882
If I did, I'd no longer be me.

01:34:00.718 --> 01:34:02.678
I've told you many times!

01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:05.807
I like everything about you.

01:34:05.849 --> 01:34:08.393
I like you, Kurosu-kun!

01:35:15.043 --> 01:35:17.587
It's not the same at all.

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:29.432
I wanted to kill someone
I really liked.

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:35.355
I understand that now.

01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:47.825
I'm glad, though.

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:11.891
Kurosu-kun...

01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:15.436
I love you!

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:23.736
Me too.

01:36:27.824 --> 01:36:29.492
I love you.

01:37:24.213 --> 01:37:26.591
Too bad about Kurosu.

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:31.304
It was the first time I got
that excited.

01:37:32.096 --> 01:37:35.058
Do you want me to clean his room?

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.692
Kurosu-kun isn't going to peep
again, huh?

01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:57.246
Hey! Don't leave me behind!

01:37:58.581 --> 01:38:00.540
It's really too bad.

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.794
Why didn't you kill him?

01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:05.797
It'd be a waste.

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:09.092
You sure are cute.

01:38:14.263 --> 01:38:17.600
Even if you live together,
you should still peep on her!

01:38:36.994 --> 01:38:39.664
I won't kill anymore.

01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:41.707
Yep!

01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:46.170
But I'll kill you someday!

01:38:46.212 --> 01:38:49.006
It won't be easy, though.

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:51.634
Feel free to do it whenever!

01:38:51.676 --> 01:38:54.095
This artery belongs to you, after all!

01:38:59.434 --> 01:39:03.354
By the way, what's your name again?

01:39:05.273 --> 01:39:07.191
Good point...

01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:10.111
We flew right past that.

01:39:12.697 --> 01:39:14.532
I'm Miyaichi Ryo!

01:39:15.158 --> 01:39:16.951
Nice to meet you!

01:39:19.287 --> 01:39:22.498
I'm Kurosu Etsuro.

01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:25.334
Nice to meet you!

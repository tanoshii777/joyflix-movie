Did you have

- Yep.
- At least you did.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.672
Maybe this'll
cheer you up.

00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:46.576
Take it.

00:04:55.252 --> 00:04:56.754
It's for you.

00:04:58.154 --> 00:05:00.822
A couple of the big ones
for us.

00:05:00.824 --> 00:05:02.727
You're crazy.

00:05:05.862 --> 00:05:08.163
- Where you goin'?
- Castili doesn't want me leaving early.

00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:10.134
To hell with Castili.

00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:13.971
Let's go have some fun.

00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:17.742
Turn that frown
upside-down.

00:05:21.144 --> 00:05:22.513
I know you
wanna have some fun.

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:43.100
I love you.

00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.503
Say that again.

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:47.805
Slower.

00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:49.673
I...

00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:52.776
love...

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:56.480
you.

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:09.060
I want a house.

00:06:10.593 --> 00:06:13.531
In the countryside,
like where you grew up.

00:06:15.132 --> 00:06:18.569
You make it sound so nice, riding
your little horsey around.

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:20.972
Let's go today.

00:06:22.838 --> 00:06:25.307
How am I gonna earn
in the country?

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:27.245
There's nothing to steal.

00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:31.079
We'll get jobs.

00:06:31.081 --> 00:06:35.786
I made more last night than most
people in the country make in a year.

00:06:36.786 --> 00:06:39.187
Gimme six months.

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.826
I'll be making more money
than Castili and all those bums.

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:54.005
Hey.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.589
I don't want to wait
six months.

00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:20.097
I'm here for the rent.

00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:24.264
All right.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

00:07:29.072 --> 00:07:31.106
- It's him.
- What the fuck?

00:07:31.108 --> 00:07:33.742
You're under arrest for
the murder of Roland Legrand.

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:35.209
What are you talkin' about?

00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:37.281
Well, he was murdered last night.
A witness identified you.

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:39.714
The pimp,
Roland Legrand.

00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:42.983
You know him, right?

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:46.654
- You got the wrong guy, pal. I was with her all night.
- Come on. Let's go.

00:07:46.656 --> 00:07:48.757
- All right. Let me get dressed.
- No, no, no, no.

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.927
We got some stripes at the
station for you, pretty boy.

00:07:51.728 --> 00:07:53.027
This is bullshit.

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:54.762
- I didn't kill anyone.
- You can't do that.

00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:56.664
- He was with me!
- Nennete, relax.

00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:58.767
- They got nothin'.
- Nobody believes a whore.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.801
- Nennete!
- Get back in your room.

00:08:00.803 --> 00:08:02.870
Honestly,
I'll be back in no time.

00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:05.707
- Papi! Papi!
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:06.911
Papi!

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:11.712
Papi!

00:08:11.714 --> 00:08:13.014
Papi!

00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:15.050
He didn't kill anyone!

00:08:15.052 --> 00:08:17.418
He was with me!

00:08:57.827 --> 00:08:59.396
Step away from the bars!

00:09:01.097 --> 00:09:03.099
I can't believe they gave
you a life sentence.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.873
You need to appeal.

00:09:09.438 --> 00:09:11.107
Appeal what?

00:09:12.808 --> 00:09:14.943
Nennete,
this is a frame-up.

00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:16.781
They're all in on it.

00:09:18.414 --> 00:09:20.384
I just need to concentrate
on breaking out.

00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:23.450
Okay.

00:09:23.452 --> 00:09:26.887
First thing I'm gonna do when I get
back is kill that lying rat witness

00:09:26.889 --> 00:09:29.223
and anyone who has anything
to do with this.

00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:32.028
- Calm down.
- All visitors have to leave!

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.231
Nennete, you need
to forget about me.

00:09:37.234 --> 00:09:39.269
Don't say that.

00:09:40.403 --> 00:09:41.802
I love you.

00:09:41.804 --> 00:09:44.171
- Time's up, lady.
- Papi, I love you.

00:09:44.173 --> 00:09:47.776
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

00:09:47.778 --> 00:09:50.411
- Come on. Come on. Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

00:09:59.923 --> 00:10:02.460
Papillon, right?
They fucked you good, huh?

00:10:03.393 --> 00:10:05.162
Framed you
for murder.

00:10:06.363 --> 00:10:08.563
Say you're one hell
of a safecracker.

00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:10.801
I'm more of a smash-and-grab
guy myself. Name's Julot.

00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:14.038
Got any money?

00:10:14.937 --> 00:10:17.204
No?

00:10:17.206 --> 00:10:20.110
Get some. You'll never
escape without it.

00:10:23.813 --> 00:10:25.914
Keep goin', keep goin'.
Let's keep goin'.

00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:28.483
- Next. Move forward.
- Next, come on!

00:10:28.485 --> 00:10:30.754
- Let's go, let's go.
- Next.

00:10:31.453 --> 00:10:33.923
- Line up.
- Go to the end.

00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:36.326
Come on. Move along.

00:10:40.429 --> 00:10:42.430
- Stay in line.
- Hey.

00:10:42.432 --> 00:10:46.334
- Perhaps I could speak with your supervisor.
- Sure.

00:10:46.336 --> 00:10:47.937
Whatever you say.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.907
Louis Dega.
Guy's a millionaire.

00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:56.611
Busted making counterfeit
defense bonds.

00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:59.113
- Won't last long.
- Next.

00:10:59.115 --> 00:11:02.249
Every con in the prison will wanna cut
him open to get the money he's carrying.

00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:04.087
Next.

00:11:09.491 --> 00:11:12.026
As of this moment,

00:11:12.028 --> 00:11:16.598
you are the property of the Penal
Administration of French Guiana.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.300
After serving
your full term in prison,

00:11:19.302 --> 00:11:22.302
you will remain in South America

00:11:22.304 --> 00:11:27.410
as workers and colonists for a period
equal to that of your original sentence.

00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:34.150
This is for the greater good
that is French expansion.

00:11:35.184 --> 00:11:36.853
As for France...

00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:41.122
she has disowned you.

00:11:41.124 --> 00:11:46.263
She has rid herself
of you... altogether.

00:11:47.197 --> 00:11:50.000
Forget France.

00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:53.303
Now dress yourselves.

00:12:06.582 --> 00:12:08.215
Are we going to hell?

00:12:08.217 --> 00:12:10.153
Look up. Just keep walking.

00:12:19.195 --> 00:12:20.865
Mr. Dega.

00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:25.300
Your appeal is
in a few weeks.

00:12:25.302 --> 00:12:27.037
Be strong, Louis.
I love you.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.340
I love you.

00:12:31.073 --> 00:12:32.272
You'll be home
before Christmas.

00:12:32.274 --> 00:12:36.579
Dega. Mr. Dega, here.
Look this way. Mr. Dega.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.527
Sixty-nine, 70.

00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:55.696
- That's right.
- Move it!

00:12:55.698 --> 00:12:57.098
That's enough.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.069
Pick your feet up.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.614
Hey, Julot!

00:13:14.616 --> 00:13:15.650
All right, pair up.

00:13:15.652 --> 00:13:17.254
- Hey.
- Take the corner.

00:13:22.491 --> 00:13:24.661
Looks like Dega's
making friends already.

00:13:26.162 --> 00:13:29.365
Julot, make sure
no one takes this hammock.

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:35.136
Hey.

00:13:35.138 --> 00:13:38.373
I saved you a spot next to me.

00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:40.110
You got a lot of eyes on you.

00:13:41.477 --> 00:13:43.710
I can keep you safe.

00:13:43.712 --> 00:13:46.216
All I need's enough money
for an escape.

00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:49.650
Won't be cheap,
but you'll be safe.

00:13:49.652 --> 00:13:52.387
Said the scorpion to the frog.

00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:55.089
We're all scorpions
in here, pal.

00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:58.792
I think I'd be better off taking my chances
setting up in front of the guards.

00:13:58.794 --> 00:14:01.262
Wouldn't you agree?

00:14:01.264 --> 00:14:04.000
You seem like the kind of man
who can make up his own mind.

00:14:05.134 --> 00:14:07.236
You're a good judge
of character.

00:14:09.505 --> 00:14:11.408
Have a good night.

00:14:12.174 --> 00:14:14.010
Yeah, you too.

00:14:21.384 --> 00:14:22.650
Hey.

00:14:22.652 --> 00:14:24.455
Me and you, we should team up
for an escape.

00:14:26.556 --> 00:14:30.561
If I get caught in some half-assed
escape, I want it to be my mistake.

00:14:35.298 --> 00:14:36.734
Settle down now!

00:15:19.475 --> 00:15:21.142
Shh.

00:15:35.357 --> 00:15:38.161
I know you hide your money
in your guts.

00:16:23.572 --> 00:16:24.707
Upper deck.

00:16:25.807 --> 00:16:26.742
Move it back.
Back, you.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.676
Back. Back up.

00:16:29.678 --> 00:16:31.115
Get him outta here.

00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:34.648
The animals can clean up
their own mess.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.483
Come on. Get rid of him.

00:16:36.485 --> 00:16:38.154
Show's over.

00:17:04.881 --> 00:17:07.184
How'd you sleep last night?

00:17:13.855 --> 00:17:16.289
Smells like freedom.

00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:18.694
What, you've heard of someone
escaping the prison?

00:17:19.761 --> 00:17:21.629
Doesn't mean
it can't be done.

00:17:21.631 --> 00:17:24.632
I have trouble seeing hope
in hopelessness.

00:17:24.634 --> 00:17:26.603
That's why I need
a man like you.

00:17:28.238 --> 00:17:30.571
I've reconsidered your offer.

00:17:30.573 --> 00:17:33.975
Keep me alive until
I'm set up on the island,

00:17:33.977 --> 00:17:36.280
I'll underwrite any escape
you care to arrange.

00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:44.354
All right.

00:17:47.323 --> 00:17:49.793
And when the time comes,
you're not comin' with me.

00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:54.728
I have no intention
of escaping.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.398
Unlike you,
I enjoy being alive.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.432
My wife's working
on my appeal.

00:17:59.434 --> 00:18:01.804
I'm confident
I'll be home by Christmas.

00:18:04.507 --> 00:18:06.643
A fellow optimist.

00:18:19.388 --> 00:18:21.390
Four.

00:18:21.857 --> 00:18:22.658
Two.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.323
Look what the fuck you did!

00:19:02.464 --> 00:19:03.332
Get the knife!

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.869
Come on!
Get the knife!

00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:11.707
Get the knife!

00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:46.606
I'll kill you!

00:19:46.608 --> 00:19:48.944
Steam! Turn on the steam!

00:19:49.811 --> 00:19:50.746
Fuck you!

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.931
Come on,
come on, come on.

00:20:11.933 --> 00:20:13.603
Get back!

00:20:16.105 --> 00:20:19.105
Strip and line up, you fuckin'
animals, or it's the steam again.

00:20:19.107 --> 00:20:21.808
Strip down!

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.710
Gimme the fuckin' knife.

00:20:23.712 --> 00:20:25.813
- Move it!
- Come on. Line up back there!

00:20:25.815 --> 00:20:28.849
Let's go! Strip down!

00:20:28.851 --> 00:20:31.584
- Come on, come on.
- On your feet.

00:20:31.586 --> 00:20:33.687
Line up back there.

00:20:33.689 --> 00:20:36.123
Strip down.
Strip right up.

00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:38.758
Hands. Hands out.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.128
- Everybody, hands out.
- Everyone, let's have your hands out.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.863
Let's see.
What you got?

00:20:42.865 --> 00:20:44.164
Get him to the infirmary.

00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:46.132
Let's get this
piece of meat outta here.

00:20:46.134 --> 00:20:48.134
- Show me your hands. Let's see.
- Turn 'em over.

00:20:48.136 --> 00:20:49.702
You.

00:20:49.704 --> 00:20:51.705
This one's been fighting
for sure.

00:20:51.707 --> 00:20:53.474
Take him to first class.

00:20:53.476 --> 00:20:56.209
Come on. Come on!

00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:57.911
Time to go.

00:20:57.913 --> 00:20:59.383
First class, let's go.

00:21:00.782 --> 00:21:03.386
Try and behave, ladies.

00:21:36.952 --> 00:21:38.454
You should have finished him.

00:21:40.722 --> 00:21:41.857
I don't want to kill anyone.

00:21:46.162 --> 00:21:48.962
I'm gonna get myself sent
to the hospital.

00:21:48.964 --> 00:21:51.131
Let me know if a guard
looks this way.

00:21:51.133 --> 00:21:53.635
- Do not stop!
- Get a move on!

00:21:57.507 --> 00:21:58.572
Shh.

00:22:00.643 --> 00:22:02.979
Move it, now! You two!

00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:08.148
- Move it! Move it!
- Crazy, Julot.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.884
Go that way! You go this way!
You two, come on down.

00:22:10.886 --> 00:22:12.853
Form a line.

00:22:12.855 --> 00:22:15.655
Form a line, I said.
Form a line. Go ahead.

00:22:15.657 --> 00:22:18.057
You two, you stay here.
Go back in line.

00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:19.093
Move.

00:22:19.095 --> 00:22:21.295
Move it! Come on!
That way!

00:22:21.297 --> 00:22:24.097
Come on! Move it!
Come on.

00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:26.901
I said move it, goddamn it.
Get up. Get up!

00:22:26.903 --> 00:22:28.235
- Come on.
- Move along! Move along!

00:22:28.237 --> 00:22:30.170
Eyes straight.
Eyes straight.

00:22:30.172 --> 00:22:32.072
- Come on. Move it.
- Move it!

00:22:32.074 --> 00:22:33.641
- That way.
- Down the ladder!

00:22:33.643 --> 00:22:35.142
- Over there. Come on.
- Faster!

00:22:35.144 --> 00:22:36.809
Move it. Move it!

00:22:36.811 --> 00:22:38.578
- Come on now.
- Come on. Move.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.748
Don't be looking at me
like that.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.315
- Come on. Move.
- You too.

00:22:42.317 --> 00:22:44.250
Move along.

00:22:44.252 --> 00:22:46.620
Guys, get him up!

00:22:46.622 --> 00:22:50.026
My fucking leg!

00:22:52.228 --> 00:22:55.028
My leg. My leg!

00:22:58.267 --> 00:23:01.067
That's enough.
That's enough.

00:23:01.069 --> 00:23:03.269
Break it up. Break it up.
That's enough.

00:23:03.271 --> 00:23:05.338
- Move it!
- Move. Back to the line.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.907
Move, move.

00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:08.778
Raise your hand
if I call your name.

00:23:09.912 --> 00:23:11.581
Augustin.

00:23:13.749 --> 00:23:16.853
- Barba.
- Come on now. Stay in line.

00:23:17.653 --> 00:23:19.055
Bellaire.

00:23:20.021 --> 00:23:21.788
Move along! Over there.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.527
Lofton.

00:23:26.061 --> 00:23:27.863
Navarrone.

00:23:29.632 --> 00:23:31.664
Navarrone.

00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:32.701
Move out!

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.072
Move out!

00:23:54.856 --> 00:23:57.027
All right, come on.
Move it.

00:23:59.161 --> 00:24:00.997
Keep moving!

00:24:05.166 --> 00:24:07.202
Prisoners, halt!

00:24:08.671 --> 00:24:09.639
Open the gates.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.108
March.

00:25:37.926 --> 00:25:40.728
I know many of you at this very
moment are thinking about escape.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.396
Feel free to try
whenever you like.

00:25:43.398 --> 00:25:45.200
We'll be happy to shoot you.

00:25:46.769 --> 00:25:50.036
If, however, you should
avoid that mercy,

00:25:50.038 --> 00:25:54.040
there are two guardians
who are always on duty...

00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:57.246
The bush, where the best thing that
can happen to you is starvation.

00:25:58.513 --> 00:26:01.347
Or you could choose the sea,

00:26:01.349 --> 00:26:04.286
where sharks too, I assure
you, are always hungry.

00:26:06.221 --> 00:26:09.222
If you manage to survive
your first attempt,

00:26:09.224 --> 00:26:12.191
you'll get two years
in solitary.

00:26:12.193 --> 00:26:14.361
Second attempt,
five years in solitary,

00:26:14.363 --> 00:26:16.865
followed by a life sentence
at Devil's Island.

00:26:18.267 --> 00:26:19.969
If you commit murder...

00:26:21.804 --> 00:26:23.339
you'll be executed.

00:26:25.374 --> 00:26:26.776
That's all.

00:26:43.526 --> 00:26:45.095
Move. Move.

00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:02.045
Jesus Christ.

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:12.788
Take the corner.

00:27:21.997 --> 00:27:23.967
Hey, keep your eyes open
and don't move.

00:27:27.102 --> 00:27:28.338
Hey.

00:27:29.872 --> 00:27:32.475
Who decides what work
we get assigned to?

00:27:35.211 --> 00:27:38.213
- Excuse my ill-mannered...
- I thought I told you not to move.

00:27:39.414 --> 00:27:41.081
He has yet to be tamed.

00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:44.151
And you're obviously a very
important, very, very busy man.

00:27:44.153 --> 00:27:46.152
I'm just the turnkey.

00:27:46.154 --> 00:27:50.457
We're looking for someone
to ensure we're assigned

00:27:50.459 --> 00:27:52.796
the right sort of work
in the morning.

00:27:54.063 --> 00:27:56.263
It'll cost you a thousand.

00:27:56.265 --> 00:27:57.396
I don't think so.

00:27:57.398 --> 00:27:59.368
No, now that seems
entirely too high.

00:28:03.038 --> 00:28:06.172
Sir, I think we started
off on the wrong foot.

00:28:06.174 --> 00:28:10.009
I think a thousand
is actually fair.

00:28:10.011 --> 00:28:11.545
Now, is there a selection
of work you have...

00:28:11.547 --> 00:28:15.082
Attendants at
the hospital.

00:28:15.084 --> 00:28:17.316
And for a thousand, you can
throw in a pouch of tobacco.

00:28:17.318 --> 00:28:19.151
- And a notebook.
- A notebook?

00:28:19.153 --> 00:28:21.421
- I'm an artist.
- You're a forger.

00:28:21.423 --> 00:28:25.459
And you're a safecracker, a profession
of which I thoroughly disapprove.

00:28:25.461 --> 00:28:27.193
- At least I'm an honest criminal.
- Hmm.

00:28:27.195 --> 00:28:29.999
Hey. I'm gonna need that
right now.

00:28:30.665 --> 00:28:32.099
I mean, right now.

00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:33.469
Excuse me.

00:28:36.105 --> 00:28:40.143
I think you need to go
to the bathroom.

00:28:43.278 --> 00:28:45.048
Yes, of course.

00:28:46.115 --> 00:28:48.884
If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen.

00:28:52.421 --> 00:28:54.621
Where you goin'?

00:28:54.623 --> 00:28:56.426
I've never
been here before.

00:28:58.326 --> 00:29:00.496
Toilet's there,
princess.

00:29:08.703 --> 00:29:13.509
What animal but a man keeps his
only means of survival up his ass?

00:29:55.483 --> 00:29:57.519
Something bit me.

00:30:11.165 --> 00:30:13.432
We got a runner!

00:30:13.434 --> 00:30:16.436
- Lockdown!
- Lock it down!

00:30:16.438 --> 00:30:18.572
- Which barracks?
- No, he broke out the hospital.

00:30:18.574 --> 00:30:19.773
- Just one.
- The hospital?

00:30:19.775 --> 00:30:21.208
Lock down
your barrack.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:24.411
- I'll bet that's Julot.
- Lock it down!

00:30:24.413 --> 00:30:26.281
Son of a bitch
didn't waste any time.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.519
You see?

00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:35.322
It can be done.

00:30:35.324 --> 00:30:38.394
Lock it down! Into the jungle.
Stand down.

00:30:41.262 --> 00:30:42.664
Route Zero.

00:30:46.201 --> 00:30:47.336
Route Zero.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.173
Route Zero.

00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:57.411
My friend and I need to be
kept together at all times.

00:30:57.413 --> 00:31:00.080
Set these two up
in the hospital.

00:31:00.082 --> 00:31:02.349
And it'll be a few days before I'm
well enough to do any sort of...

00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:04.187
Don't push it.

00:31:05.453 --> 00:31:08.023
Both of them,
Route Zero.

00:31:10.526 --> 00:31:12.562
Mr. Dega, stop.

00:31:16.765 --> 00:31:19.833
I know you.
Do you know me?

00:31:19.835 --> 00:31:22.701
Yes.
Yes, of course, sir.

00:31:22.703 --> 00:31:24.603
You're the deputy
warden, sir.

00:31:24.605 --> 00:31:27.740
My sister's husband
was arrested

00:31:27.742 --> 00:31:31.179
selling counterfeit defense bonds you
furnished him with in Marseilles.

00:31:33.548 --> 00:31:36.816
Dega is a very common name
in Marseilles.

00:31:36.818 --> 00:31:39.385
- Santini.
- Yes, sir.

00:31:39.387 --> 00:31:42.088
This one goes straight
to Route Zero.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.492
Take him away.

00:31:44.226 --> 00:31:45.792
Wait.

00:31:45.794 --> 00:31:47.330
Take him too.

00:31:50.699 --> 00:31:53.333
We try not to separate
old friends here.

00:31:53.335 --> 00:31:56.038
Get them to Route Zero.
Move.

00:31:56.672 --> 00:31:59.107
What is Route Zero?

00:32:03.345 --> 00:32:05.213
Stand clear!

00:32:10.451 --> 00:32:12.320
Your other round!

00:32:14.522 --> 00:32:16.123
I don't feel so good.

00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:17.359
Watch it now!

00:32:20.528 --> 00:32:22.664
It go...
It goes in the cart.

00:32:25.233 --> 00:32:26.499
Move along.

00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:27.801
You do a lot
of talking.

00:32:27.803 --> 00:32:29.835
- I do?
- Yeah. Stop that.

00:32:29.837 --> 00:32:32.506
It passes...
It passes the time.

00:32:32.508 --> 00:32:35.444
- Get outta my face. Get outta my face.
- You take the bigger rock.

00:32:40.582 --> 00:32:44.153
You get into a fight with
him, I'm not protecting you.

00:33:17.219 --> 00:33:18.754
If your wife was here...

00:33:19.922 --> 00:33:22.557
you were in Paris
with all that money,

00:33:23.791 --> 00:33:26.228
how much would you pay
to get her back?

00:33:27.796 --> 00:33:29.699
Everything I have.

00:33:32.968 --> 00:33:35.705
How much would she pay
for you?

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:47.250
You're a real optimist.

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.528
Little man. Little man.
You need to put some weight in.

00:34:33.894 --> 00:34:36.295
You can push harder
than that. Come on.

00:34:36.297 --> 00:34:37.831
Trust me, he can't.

00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:40.833
Trust me,
he has to.

00:34:40.835 --> 00:34:42.671
Come on! Push it!

00:34:47.009 --> 00:34:48.911
- Push it!
- Pick up the pace.

00:34:51.413 --> 00:34:54.546
I have... I have diarrhea.

00:34:54.548 --> 00:34:56.615
What you want me
to do about it?

00:34:56.617 --> 00:34:58.651
No, you don't understand.

00:34:58.653 --> 00:35:01.590
I lost the money.

00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:12.699
What's the holdup?

00:35:12.701 --> 00:35:15.735
What the hell are you doing?

00:35:15.737 --> 00:35:18.070
- What?
- Stop shitting around.

00:35:18.072 --> 00:35:20.307
- You'll get us all killed.
- You mind your own cart.

00:35:20.309 --> 00:35:22.708
The little guy is making more
work for the rest of us.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.714
- Mind your own business.
- Break it up. Break it up.

00:35:27.748 --> 00:35:30.717
What are you doing?
Get up.

00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:32.855
Get up! Get up.

00:35:35.856 --> 00:35:37.691
- On your feet.
- I can't.

00:35:37.693 --> 00:35:39.559
Pick him up.

00:35:39.561 --> 00:35:41.364
Come on, pick him up.
Put him in the cart.

00:35:46.367 --> 00:35:48.668
Back to work.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.572
Move your carts.

00:36:03.018 --> 00:36:06.720
You had one job to do.
You couldn't do it.

00:36:06.722 --> 00:36:09.088
My body's in revolt.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:10.458
Where is it now?

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.728
Where do you think?

00:36:16.597 --> 00:36:18.867
I should have known better
than to trust a thief.

00:36:23.804 --> 00:36:25.572
I can't steal
what's already mine.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:33.045
As soon as we get back to the
barracks, you're taking it back.

00:36:33.047 --> 00:36:34.646
And you're gonna hold onto
it this time.

00:36:34.648 --> 00:36:37.385
I don't care if you have
to sew your ass up to do it.

00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:50.665
I'm sorry.

00:36:53.001 --> 00:36:57.907
I may have prematurely judged you
with an unworthy degree of suspicion.

00:36:59.074 --> 00:37:01.141
Well, don't propose yet.

00:37:01.143 --> 00:37:02.878
I just don't like
carrying things in my ass.

00:37:09.951 --> 00:37:11.420
Mmm.

00:37:27.436 --> 00:37:29.135
He's dead.

00:37:29.137 --> 00:37:31.637
- He's dead!
- Shut up, birdie.

00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:34.076
Are you stupid or what?

00:37:35.943 --> 00:37:38.079
We share his ration.
Here.

00:37:44.186 --> 00:37:45.954
Here.

00:37:47.655 --> 00:37:50.425
So you got yourself a boyfriend, huh?

00:38:00.235 --> 00:38:02.104
You were in the navy?

00:38:04.806 --> 00:38:07.139
What do you think?

00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:08.977
I thought maybe
it meant "jailbird."

00:38:10.144 --> 00:38:13.847
Swallows.
It stands for hope.

00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:15.617
First thing you see
when you reach land.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.853
- I know.
- Yeah? How come?

00:38:20.222 --> 00:38:21.787
You were in the navy?

00:38:21.789 --> 00:38:24.224
Eighteen months.

00:38:24.226 --> 00:38:26.961
Followed by six in the brig.
Didn't suit me.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.130
A butterfly.

00:38:31.132 --> 00:38:33.766
So you're a thief now?

00:38:33.768 --> 00:38:36.005
Guess that didn't
suit you either.

00:38:45.246 --> 00:38:47.615
We should go sailing
sometime.

00:38:51.987 --> 00:38:53.889
You got a boat?

00:38:56.056 --> 00:38:58.691
Can you get any
of that?

00:38:58.693 --> 00:38:59.528
Maybe.

00:39:02.197 --> 00:39:03.632
Well, let me know then.

00:39:08.802 --> 00:39:11.637
Your boyfriend's
got trouble.

00:39:11.639 --> 00:39:13.639
Give me your money, or you
and your friend will die.

00:39:16.244 --> 00:39:18.610
- Is there trouble?
- I was talking to your bitch.

00:39:18.612 --> 00:39:20.012
Now you're talking to me.

00:39:22.918 --> 00:39:24.983
Work it out in the barracks!

00:39:24.985 --> 00:39:27.153
Break is over.

00:39:27.155 --> 00:39:29.191
Get in line!

00:39:30.891 --> 00:39:33.061
Break is over.
Forward march.

00:39:36.097 --> 00:39:38.865
Line it up.
Line it up!

00:39:41.769 --> 00:39:45.271
Stop. Stop!

00:39:45.273 --> 00:39:47.874
Turn around. Eyes up front.
Come on.

00:39:51.012 --> 00:39:54.713
You know better than to truck your
ladies through here after a rainstorm.

00:39:54.715 --> 00:39:58.083
Yeah.
Can you help me out?

00:39:58.085 --> 00:39:59.619
I'll make it good for you.

00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:02.021
Get the girls up here.

00:40:02.023 --> 00:40:02.958
Come on.

00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:05.291
Watch out.

00:40:05.293 --> 00:40:07.159
Watch out...

00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:13.969
Hey.

00:40:17.371 --> 00:40:19.074
Can you hear me?

00:40:20.976 --> 00:40:23.742
How much to take me
up the coast?

00:40:23.744 --> 00:40:25.711
Don't be stupid.

00:40:25.713 --> 00:40:27.750
I'll give you 2,000.

00:40:31.286 --> 00:40:32.619
Guard!

00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:34.987
Don't turn me in,
for Christ's sake.

00:40:34.989 --> 00:40:37.389
4,000.

00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:38.860
What's the problem?

00:40:40.661 --> 00:40:44.363
Just wanted to know which girl
I should send to repay you.

00:40:44.365 --> 00:40:46.869
One that hasn't
caught anything yet.

00:40:50.304 --> 00:40:54.374
My boat is on the other
side of the river.

00:40:54.376 --> 00:40:56.675
I'll be there for
three more days.

00:40:56.677 --> 00:40:58.279
It's 5,000.

00:40:59.246 --> 00:41:00.979
You're a goddamned thief.

00:42:55.329 --> 00:42:58.733
- The guards are coming.
- Don't fucking touch me!

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:45.077
I didn't know
it would be like this.

00:43:45.079 --> 00:43:48.182
I'll be dead long before
my appeal.

00:43:51.485 --> 00:43:54.021
I need to go with you.

00:44:00.994 --> 00:44:03.028
That wasn't part
of the deal.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:07.068
Yes, I realize that, but I
still have to go with you.

00:44:13.141 --> 00:44:15.344
You ever sail a boat?

00:44:17.846 --> 00:44:20.315
Spend any time at sea?

00:44:23.451 --> 00:44:26.985
Yes, I have spent a
number of days at sea.

00:44:26.987 --> 00:44:29.090
I was locked in a cage
for most of them.

00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:34.459
But I think I understand
the concept well enough.

00:44:34.461 --> 00:44:36.494
You can't come
with me, Dega.

00:44:40.934 --> 00:44:43.237
You should call me Louis.

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:57.251
Keep it moving.

00:44:59.186 --> 00:45:00.188
Get 'em in line.

00:45:03.324 --> 00:45:05.092
Stand straight!

00:45:12.666 --> 00:45:14.268
Down on your knees.

00:45:16.336 --> 00:45:19.307
Take off your hats
and cross your arms.

00:45:22.277 --> 00:45:27.282
At the moment of execution,
you're all to bow your heads.

00:45:45.199 --> 00:45:47.436
A man stabbed two guards...

00:45:49.202 --> 00:45:51.970
one of whom died this morning,

00:45:51.972 --> 00:45:55.309
leaving two children
without their father.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:58.177
And for what?

00:45:58.179 --> 00:46:00.545
So he could go on a run
through the jungle.

00:46:00.547 --> 00:46:03.084
Thank you
for coming!

00:46:05.052 --> 00:46:07.521
Watch me go to hell!

00:46:51.398 --> 00:46:52.967
Prisoner ready.

00:47:07.681 --> 00:47:11.519
Keeping you is no benefit.
Destroying you is no loss.

00:47:17.125 --> 00:47:18.624
You.

00:47:18.626 --> 00:47:19.995
Pick another inmate.

00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:22.998
You carry the body.

00:48:22.155 --> 00:48:25.124
Go get
the boat ready.

00:48:53.753 --> 00:48:55.623
He's gone.

00:48:57.657 --> 00:49:00.061
It's just
flesh and blood.

00:49:11.204 --> 00:49:13.606
Why are you stopping?

00:49:13.608 --> 00:49:15.307
What are you doing?

00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:17.079
Move.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.650
I said, what the hell
are you doing?

00:49:23.885 --> 00:49:25.454
Get up.

00:49:27.822 --> 00:49:31.626
You get up,
you little worm.

00:49:36.297 --> 00:49:37.695
Get your ass up.

00:49:48.876 --> 00:49:50.679
You little worm.

00:49:55.483 --> 00:49:56.485
Oh, shit.

00:49:57.518 --> 00:49:58.820
Oh, shit.

00:49:59.887 --> 00:50:02.289
Stop! Hey, stop!

00:50:11.865 --> 00:50:13.865
Hey!

00:50:13.867 --> 00:50:16.170
We've got a runner!

00:50:17.438 --> 00:50:19.905
He's heading north.

00:50:19.907 --> 00:50:20.972
Papi.

00:50:20.974 --> 00:50:23.641
- Papi?
- Heading north now!

00:50:23.643 --> 00:50:26.680
Papillon!

00:50:28.882 --> 00:50:31.318
Check the tree line.

00:50:57.545 --> 00:50:59.213
Hey!

00:51:35.615 --> 00:51:37.585
Pick him up.

00:51:39.019 --> 00:51:41.389
Come on. Come on.

00:52:01.976 --> 00:52:04.778
Oh. You're a good man.

00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:11.418
Yeah, I'm a good man
that wants his money.

00:52:14.054 --> 00:52:15.820
Look, I don't have it.

00:52:15.822 --> 00:52:18.023
Not with me.

00:52:18.025 --> 00:52:19.758
But I'm gonna make it
worth your while.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.559
I got a lot of money in Paris.

00:52:21.561 --> 00:52:24.298
I'll give you
everything I got.

00:52:27.835 --> 00:52:29.304
Hmm.

00:52:44.885 --> 00:52:47.786
Even if you had the money...

00:52:47.788 --> 00:52:50.421
the warden will pay us double.

00:52:50.423 --> 00:52:51.992
Son of a bitch.

00:53:28.661 --> 00:53:31.630
You're lucky
that guard didn't die.

00:53:31.632 --> 00:53:34.532
Otherwise, you would
have met the guillotine.

00:53:34.534 --> 00:53:37.970
Now you'll be transferred to
the island of Saint Joseph,

00:53:37.972 --> 00:53:42.077
where you'll serve a two-year
sentence in solitary confinement.

00:53:43.077 --> 00:53:45.510
There's no
rehabilitation.

00:53:45.512 --> 00:53:47.646
We know that's useless,

00:53:47.648 --> 00:53:50.085
so we do our best
to break you.

00:53:54.722 --> 00:53:56.925
Strange things
happen there.

00:53:58.592 --> 00:54:01.126
Especially to those
who cling to hope,

00:54:01.128 --> 00:54:03.961
because there is no hope
on Saint Joseph.

00:54:03.963 --> 00:54:05.699
Just silence.

00:54:21.481 --> 00:54:23.715
You heard the warden.

00:54:23.717 --> 00:54:26.554
Silence must be observed
at all times.

00:57:28.302 --> 00:57:30.672
Thought you grew wings,
didn't you?

00:57:35.275 --> 00:57:36.945
Grab him.

00:57:39.278 --> 00:57:40.711
I'll teach you to be quiet.

00:57:49.222 --> 00:57:50.891
You make another peep...

00:57:52.059 --> 00:57:54.629
you might not survive
your time here.

00:58:06.773 --> 00:58:08.175
Huh.

00:58:29.429 --> 00:58:31.832
Come on. He's crazy.
Come on. Come on.

00:58:34.835 --> 00:58:36.938
Enjoy your next
two years here.

01:00:54.106 --> 01:00:56.143
Dega.

01:02:08.315 --> 01:02:10.918
Hold on.
Need to check that.

01:02:15.956 --> 01:02:19.023
What is that, hmm?

01:02:19.025 --> 01:02:21.525
Somebody paying you to bring this
shit in here? Son of a bitch.

01:02:21.527 --> 01:02:23.193
Huh? Who's paying you?

01:02:23.195 --> 01:02:25.030
Who's paying you, you son of a bitch?

01:02:27.099 --> 01:02:28.302
No!

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:32.604
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Whoa!

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.942
Jesus!
I think you killed him.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.278
Get that body out of
here and clean up the mess.

01:02:41.681 --> 01:02:43.583
What the hell
were you thinking?

01:03:04.237 --> 01:03:06.539
No wonder you haven't
broken yet.

01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:12.445
How long has it
being going on?

01:03:14.146 --> 01:03:16.217
You may speak.

01:03:19.585 --> 01:03:21.922
Who sent you
those coconuts?

01:03:33.567 --> 01:03:35.469
If you don't fess up...

01:03:37.003 --> 01:03:39.105
I'll put you on half rations.

01:03:43.175 --> 01:03:45.545
You're choosing another
man's life over your own.

01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:04.298
Put him on half rations.

01:06:11.724 --> 01:06:13.693
I brought you some soup.

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:18.666
It's got meat in it.

01:06:41.288 --> 01:06:42.690
Just tell me his name.

01:06:52.231 --> 01:06:54.168
Tell me his name.

01:07:21.827 --> 01:07:24.731
You think a person knows
when he's going mad?

01:07:27.266 --> 01:07:28.868
Or you think
it's blissful ignorance?

01:07:30.469 --> 01:07:32.172
'Cause you're about
to find out.

01:07:45.452 --> 01:07:49.019
Put him in darkness for the
remainder of his sentence.

01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:50.755
Or the remainder of his life,

01:07:50.757 --> 01:07:52.393
whichever comes first.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.449
Six.

01:10:34.087 --> 01:10:35.055
Two.

01:10:41.161 --> 01:10:42.796
Twenty-four.

01:10:58.011 --> 01:10:59.546
6-2-24.

01:11:07.153 --> 01:11:08.619
Twenty-four.

01:11:28.475 --> 01:11:30.577
This is a good escape.

01:12:35.908 --> 01:12:37.478
Is he still alive?

01:12:40.246 --> 01:12:42.082
Two years are up.

01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:26.924
I know that some of
you, at this very moment,

01:13:26.926 --> 01:13:29.263
are thinking about escape.

01:13:30.596 --> 01:13:32.830
Feel free to try
whenever you like.

01:13:32.832 --> 01:13:35.135
We'll be happy
to shoot you.

01:13:36.668 --> 01:13:39.202
However, should you
avoid that mercy,

01:13:39.204 --> 01:13:43.206
there are two guardians
who are always on duty.

01:13:43.208 --> 01:13:46.876
The bush, where the best thing that
can happen to you is starvation.

01:13:46.878 --> 01:13:49.379
Or you could choose the sea,

01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:52.683
where the sharks too,
are always hungry.

01:13:56.055 --> 01:13:59.255
If you manage to
survive your first attempt,

01:13:59.257 --> 01:14:03.027
you'll get two years
in solitary.

01:14:03.029 --> 01:14:05.362
Second attempt is
five years in solitary,

01:14:05.364 --> 01:14:07.964
followed by a life sentence
at Devil's Island.

01:14:09.301 --> 01:14:13.638
If you commit murder...

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.142
...you'll be executed.

01:14:17.176 --> 01:14:18.679
That's all.

01:14:25.018 --> 01:14:26.219
Papi.

01:14:46.805 --> 01:14:49.272
I wanted to come sooner,

01:14:49.274 --> 01:14:52.179
but I was afraid you
wouldn't wanna see me.

01:14:58.951 --> 01:15:00.186
I'm sorry.

01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:03.322
It's my fault you're here.

01:15:10.363 --> 01:15:12.362
As you predicted, um,

01:15:12.364 --> 01:15:14.233
my appeal's run into
some problems.

01:15:15.967 --> 01:15:18.468
But my wife's doing very well.

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:21.340
She recently married my lawyer.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.117
Well, to hell with her then.

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.920
You son of a bitch.

01:15:36.922 --> 01:15:39.358
I thought you'd gone
simple on me.

01:15:43.762 --> 01:15:45.666
That's the idea.

01:15:54.172 --> 01:15:56.206
You know you'd have had
a much easier time

01:15:56.208 --> 01:15:58.476
if you'd just given them
my name.

01:15:58.478 --> 01:16:01.248
It's not like
I didn't think about it.

01:16:03.448 --> 01:16:05.915
I just know how goddamn
delicate you are.

01:16:05.917 --> 01:16:07.117
Mm.

01:16:11.056 --> 01:16:13.456
I fear under
similar circumstances

01:16:13.458 --> 01:16:15.394
I would've fared
differently.

01:16:17.162 --> 01:16:19.165
I don't know how you made it.

01:16:20.365 --> 01:16:23.069
I just got used to the silence.

01:16:25.003 --> 01:16:26.739
If I ever get out...

01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:31.144
I'm gonna live
a different kind of life.

01:16:35.547 --> 01:16:39.950
This Sunday, the warden will be
showing a film in the courtyard,

01:16:39.952 --> 01:16:42.285
entertaining some
local politicians.

01:16:42.287 --> 01:16:43.987
It'll be loud.

01:16:43.989 --> 01:16:46.924
The guards will be doing
double-duty, spread very thin.

01:16:46.926 --> 01:16:49.896
This is your best chance.

01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:53.964
Can you get a boat?

01:16:53.966 --> 01:16:55.168
No.

01:16:57.103 --> 01:16:59.135
What about Celier?
Is he still here?

01:16:59.137 --> 01:17:00.907
Unfortunately, yes.

01:17:02.207 --> 01:17:04.176
If he can still get a boat...

01:17:06.546 --> 01:17:08.845
do you have enough money
to pay for it?

01:17:08.847 --> 01:17:11.917
Well, I might, but then
he'd wanna come with us.

01:17:13.452 --> 01:17:14.387
Us?

01:17:16.421 --> 01:17:17.456
Us.

01:17:21.527 --> 01:17:22.863
All right.

01:17:24.363 --> 01:17:26.066
But we still need a boat.

01:17:27.899 --> 01:17:29.433
You leave now!

01:17:29.435 --> 01:17:31.000
Leave!

01:17:31.002 --> 01:17:32.870
Get out!

01:17:32.872 --> 01:17:34.975
Get out! Leave!

01:17:35.541 --> 01:17:37.077
Get out!

01:17:38.043 --> 01:17:40.009
- This man's mad!
- Go!

01:17:40.011 --> 01:17:41.946
- Get out!
- He's out of his mind!

01:17:41.948 --> 01:17:44.013
No!
No, no, no, no!

01:17:44.015 --> 01:17:45.014
No!

01:17:45.016 --> 01:17:46.450
- No!
- He's out of his mind!

01:17:46.452 --> 01:17:48.419
Help me!
Help me!

01:17:48.421 --> 01:17:49.919
Come, Papi. Here.

01:17:49.921 --> 01:17:52.055
Come on, come... Calm down, calm down.
Let him go.

01:17:52.057 --> 01:17:53.991
Let him go!

01:17:53.993 --> 01:17:55.860
It's okay, it's okay.

01:17:55.862 --> 01:17:57.494
Shh, shh.

01:17:57.496 --> 01:17:59.162
Bring me some pills.

01:17:59.164 --> 01:18:00.598
Come on.
Take one.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.169
Bring me some water.

01:18:03.869 --> 01:18:05.070
Swallow.

01:18:08.975 --> 01:18:10.377
It'll be okay.

01:18:25.123 --> 01:18:27.092
Lights out, ten minutes.

01:18:55.654 --> 01:18:57.521
Oh!

01:18:57.523 --> 01:18:59.022
Shh, shh.

01:18:59.024 --> 01:19:01.025
- Get off of me.
- Just relax!

01:19:01.027 --> 01:19:02.159
- Leave me!
- Relax.

01:19:02.161 --> 01:19:04.128
Get off! I will never
let you fuck me.

01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:06.229
Shh, shh.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.904
You will soon, if you
know what's good for you.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.152
Hey.

01:19:29.154 --> 01:19:31.056
Hey, I just wanna talk.

01:19:33.458 --> 01:19:36.527
- I'm not a goddamn whore.
- That's not what I want.

01:19:36.529 --> 01:19:38.528
Yeah, everybody says that
until they do.

01:19:38.530 --> 01:19:41.130
Trust me, I don't.

01:19:41.132 --> 01:19:44.101
I got a different proposition.

01:19:44.103 --> 01:19:47.638
If you repeat one word of this,
it's not gonna be good for you.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.010
- I don't wanna know then.
- Maybe you do.

01:19:52.345 --> 01:19:55.278
Look, I'm puttin'
something together.

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.414
This Sunday.

01:19:57.416 --> 01:19:59.619
We got room for one more.

01:20:01.753 --> 01:20:03.720
I have nothing to offer you.

01:20:03.722 --> 01:20:06.259
I need you to distract
that turnkey.

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:12.062
Get him to come in here at a
certain time, keep him occupied.

01:20:12.064 --> 01:20:13.566
If I do that,

01:20:14.632 --> 01:20:16.036
your plan better work.

01:20:17.103 --> 01:20:18.602
It'll work.

01:20:18.604 --> 01:20:20.637
It's not gonna be easy.

01:20:20.639 --> 01:20:22.943
Can you handle yourself?

01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:27.247
You were framed
for murder, right?

01:20:30.382 --> 01:20:32.318
Well, nobody framed me.

01:20:38.690 --> 01:20:40.327
That's Celier.

01:20:41.493 --> 01:20:43.293
He's gotten us a boat.

01:20:43.295 --> 01:20:44.727
Let's see the arm.

01:20:44.729 --> 01:20:46.231
Infected.

01:20:49.635 --> 01:20:51.070
Good job.

01:20:52.371 --> 01:20:54.237
Papi!

01:20:54.239 --> 01:20:56.009
You skinny son of a bitch.

01:20:57.076 --> 01:20:58.741
Good to see you.

01:20:58.743 --> 01:21:00.777
What'd you do
to your arm?

01:21:00.779 --> 01:21:03.112
I had to cut myself
to get in here.

01:21:03.114 --> 01:21:05.449
- It still work?
- Yeah, it's nothing. Don't think about it.

01:21:05.451 --> 01:21:08.718
- I can still kick your ass.
- Can we hurry this up? I have to get back.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.322
Birdie, can you
shut up for once?

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:13.656
This is Maturette.
He's our fourth.

01:21:13.658 --> 01:21:16.527
Oh, yeah?

01:21:16.529 --> 01:21:19.062
- You know how to handle yourself?
- Yeah, with a knife.

01:21:19.064 --> 01:21:22.066
- All right, take it easy.
- Feisty little one, huh?

01:21:23.601 --> 01:21:27.103
- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm set.

01:21:27.105 --> 01:21:29.305
I got a guy that's
hiding a boat on the bank.

01:21:29.307 --> 01:21:31.842
It's upriver a ways.

01:21:31.844 --> 01:21:34.581
From there, it's a straight
shot to the ocean.

01:21:36.582 --> 01:21:38.485
But we need
half the money now.

01:21:40.819 --> 01:21:42.585
What about you?

01:21:42.587 --> 01:21:45.121
When the film starts, we'll go
through the warden's building.

01:21:45.123 --> 01:21:46.059
I'll have a key.

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.460
We got a plan.

01:21:50.462 --> 01:21:51.730
We got a plan.

01:22:00.105 --> 01:22:01.306
You all right?

01:22:02.307 --> 01:22:03.807
No.

01:22:03.809 --> 01:22:07.477
I'm not sure
we can trust him.

01:22:07.479 --> 01:22:09.713
Look at him,
he's unpredictable.

01:22:09.715 --> 01:22:11.348
He's like a caged animal.

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:13.817
We're all animals
in here, pal.

01:22:16.555 --> 01:22:17.791
He'll be fine.

01:22:19.190 --> 01:22:20.626
He needs the money now.

01:22:33.538 --> 01:22:34.838
Here.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.574
It's the sedatives
they gave me.

01:22:37.576 --> 01:22:39.910
Get 'em in the guards' coffee.

01:22:39.912 --> 01:22:41.648
We'll do the rest.

01:22:43.782 --> 01:22:45.682
I have to get back.

01:22:45.684 --> 01:22:47.153
Hey.

01:22:49.654 --> 01:22:51.356
You're doin' good.

01:23:05.904 --> 01:23:07.937
- Hey.
- What do we have here, huh?

01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:09.375
Go to hell.

01:23:10.809 --> 01:23:13.210
Give me those back.

01:23:13.212 --> 01:23:14.410
He's gonna fuck up
our plan.

01:23:14.412 --> 01:23:16.345
It's gonna be fine.

01:23:18.317 --> 01:23:20.750
What the fuck are you doing, man?

01:23:27.493 --> 01:23:29.293
All right!
That's enough!

01:23:29.295 --> 01:23:31.297
Break it up!
Break it up!

01:23:33.431 --> 01:23:34.630
He does the warden's books.

01:23:45.877 --> 01:23:48.245
I had to figure I'd know
how to throw a punch

01:23:48.247 --> 01:23:50.783
considering how often
my father used to beat me.

01:23:55.287 --> 01:23:56.489
Yours too?

01:23:57.823 --> 01:24:00.160
My parents are school teachers.

01:24:04.329 --> 01:24:05.597
See ya tonight.

01:24:17.775 --> 01:24:18.877
Anisette for the warden.

01:24:19.845 --> 01:24:21.213
The best you have.

01:24:23.649 --> 01:24:25.351
Just give me the bottle.

01:25:42.094 --> 01:25:44.628
Here's two or three.

01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:47.430
Would you gentlemen
like your coffees freshened?

01:25:47.432 --> 01:25:48.568
Bring it on in.

01:26:05.751 --> 01:26:07.750
Compliments of the warden.

01:26:07.752 --> 01:26:09.553
Wow.

01:26:09.555 --> 01:26:10.853
Very nice.

01:26:16.761 --> 01:26:17.929
Here.

01:26:22.835 --> 01:26:26.005
If we kill someone and this goes
wrong, it's the guillotine.

01:26:27.072 --> 01:26:28.474
No one dies.

01:26:53.698 --> 01:26:55.499
Give me another one
of them.

01:26:55.501 --> 01:26:56.869
All right.

01:27:13.185 --> 01:27:14.518
Dega!

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.452
Where are you going?

01:27:16.454 --> 01:27:17.754
Dega!

01:27:17.756 --> 01:27:19.525
The warden.
Now!

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.660
Stop!
Shh, shh!

01:27:56.662 --> 01:27:57.794
Shh, shh!

01:27:57.796 --> 01:27:59.963
What was that?

01:27:59.965 --> 01:28:01.567
I'd better go check.

01:28:25.023 --> 01:28:26.626
It's working.

01:28:49.081 --> 01:28:51.615
Oh, man.

01:28:51.617 --> 01:28:53.485
We're too early.

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.019
Hey, got a light?

01:28:57.021 --> 01:28:58.722
Yes, of course, sir.

01:29:09.234 --> 01:29:11.668
Oh! Oh!
Okay, go inside.

01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:14.036
Everybody, go inside.
Come on.

01:29:14.038 --> 01:29:15.675
- Come on, darling.
- Fuck.

01:29:16.975 --> 01:29:19.212
- That's our way out.
- No, no.

01:29:26.918 --> 01:29:28.617
What's he doin'?

01:29:33.024 --> 01:29:34.324
- Power's off!
- Fuck!

01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:42.031
Papi, we gotta move.
We can't stay here.

01:29:42.033 --> 01:29:44.334
We wait for Dega.

01:29:44.336 --> 01:29:46.602
Forget about Dega!

01:29:46.604 --> 01:29:48.338
He's not reliable.

01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:50.005
And you know it!

01:29:50.007 --> 01:29:52.576
Let's just go.
Come on.

01:29:52.578 --> 01:29:54.311
You wanna go?

01:29:54.313 --> 01:29:55.681
Go.

01:29:57.582 --> 01:29:58.617
You with me?

01:29:59.984 --> 01:30:01.786
Uh, yeah.
Open the gate.

01:30:02.854 --> 01:30:04.090
What's wrong with you?

01:30:09.994 --> 01:30:14.030
Ha! I stole the keys to get
us up to the central walkway.

01:30:14.032 --> 01:30:16.599
We can take that
to the guard tower.

01:30:16.601 --> 01:30:20.070
As long as the lights stay off,
they won't see us.

01:30:20.072 --> 01:30:21.905
And then we jump?

01:30:21.907 --> 01:30:23.543
You got a better idea?

01:30:31.649 --> 01:30:32.682
Come on.

01:30:32.684 --> 01:30:33.920
Come on!

01:30:38.657 --> 01:30:40.025
Go, go!

01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:46.731
Guard the wall!

01:30:48.065 --> 01:30:49.833
You! Take me
to the south wall.

01:30:49.835 --> 01:30:51.835
Yes, sir!

01:31:09.854 --> 01:31:10.954
Oh, shit.

01:31:10.956 --> 01:31:12.692
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

01:31:14.025 --> 01:31:15.293
Easy.

01:31:22.333 --> 01:31:24.433
You all right?

01:31:24.435 --> 01:31:26.268
Let's go!
Come on!

01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:27.806
Go, go, go.

01:31:46.425 --> 01:31:47.927
Come on!

01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:49.961
Jump!

01:31:51.095 --> 01:31:52.330
Come on!

01:31:56.368 --> 01:31:58.300
Come on!
Come on!

01:31:58.302 --> 01:32:00.006
They're gonna see you!
Come on!

01:32:03.341 --> 01:32:05.008
Come on!

01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:06.710
Jump!
Come on!

01:32:06.712 --> 01:32:09.912
Jump!

01:32:10.916 --> 01:32:12.048
Shit!

01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:13.282
Hey.
It's broken.

01:32:13.284 --> 01:32:15.317
- Leave him.
- He's got the money.

01:32:15.319 --> 01:32:17.019
Aah.

01:32:17.021 --> 01:32:18.390
Maturette, help me.

01:32:19.725 --> 01:32:20.956
Christ!

01:32:20.958 --> 01:32:22.728
All right, come on.

01:32:24.296 --> 01:32:25.231
Let's go.

01:32:35.506 --> 01:32:36.875
Come on.

01:32:41.979 --> 01:32:43.746
How much further
to the boat?

01:32:43.748 --> 01:32:45.281
You're slowing us down,
Dega.

01:32:45.283 --> 01:32:48.120
Come on.
We've got to move faster.

01:33:14.779 --> 01:33:17.148
Don't take another step.

01:33:19.150 --> 01:33:20.885
You're not takin' me back.

01:33:22.287 --> 01:33:24.923
That depends
if you have my money.

01:33:29.927 --> 01:33:30.996
Hey.

01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:33.897
Papi.
It's okay.

01:33:33.899 --> 01:33:35.367
This is my guy
with the boat.

01:33:41.539 --> 01:33:43.005
Where's our boat?

01:33:43.007 --> 01:33:45.208
It's a ways up the river.

01:33:45.210 --> 01:33:48.076
Want me to take you
there, pay me.

01:33:48.078 --> 01:33:49.180
Or fuck you.

01:34:03.528 --> 01:34:05.798
This is all I have left.

01:34:11.235 --> 01:34:13.338
Let's keep that between us.

01:34:35.193 --> 01:34:36.862
Enjoy your freedom!

01:35:24.408 --> 01:35:27.110
Fuck! What kind of
shit boat did you get us?

01:35:27.112 --> 01:35:29.111
Shut up, Dega!

01:35:29.113 --> 01:35:31.580
You're lucky to be here.
Keep bailing!

01:35:31.582 --> 01:35:33.282
Get it outta the boat.

01:35:33.284 --> 01:35:35.585
I'm trying.

01:35:35.587 --> 01:35:37.620
Don't throw it at me, Dega.
Goddamn it.

01:35:37.622 --> 01:35:39.522
- Throw it in the water!
- I'm throwing it at the water.

01:35:39.524 --> 01:35:41.257
- Maturette!
- Yes?

01:35:41.259 --> 01:35:42.161
Check the tiller.

01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:45.497
I got it,
I got it.

01:35:50.467 --> 01:35:52.134
Papi.

01:35:52.136 --> 01:35:54.469
This boat can't hold all of us.
You know it.

01:35:54.471 --> 01:35:56.041
We need to lighten
the weight.

01:36:03.213 --> 01:36:05.415
He's gonna die anyway, Papi.

01:36:05.417 --> 01:36:07.215
Nobody needs to die.

01:36:07.217 --> 01:36:09.451
Fuck!
It fell off!

01:36:09.453 --> 01:36:11.321
- Fix the tiller!
- It's broken.

01:36:11.323 --> 01:36:12.524
Fix the tiller!

01:36:13.524 --> 01:36:15.157
Move!

01:36:23.134 --> 01:36:24.336
Come on.

01:36:59.104 --> 01:37:01.737
Here, take this.
Take this.

01:37:01.739 --> 01:37:03.141
Maturette, help me.

01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:20.623
This storm is
gonna sink the boat.

01:37:20.625 --> 01:37:22.791
We need to act,
and we need to act now.

01:37:22.793 --> 01:37:24.329
Just let me get
the boat ready.

01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:27.533
Did you lose your mind?
Huh?

01:37:28.666 --> 01:37:30.599
You wanna die
because of this guy?

01:37:30.601 --> 01:37:32.671
Nobody needs to die.

01:37:37.442 --> 01:37:38.577
Well, we can't all live.

01:37:39.577 --> 01:37:42.378
Dega, he's dead weight.

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:44.149
How much money you have?

01:37:46.717 --> 01:37:48.785
He doesn't have any money.

01:37:48.787 --> 01:37:50.786
He doesn't have any money?

01:37:50.788 --> 01:37:52.687
You hear that, Maturette?

01:37:52.689 --> 01:37:54.259
They've been lying to us.

01:37:55.793 --> 01:37:57.261
You wanna die for him?

01:38:00.265 --> 01:38:01.763
That makes it
two against one, Papi.

01:38:01.765 --> 01:38:03.331
Step aside.

01:38:03.333 --> 01:38:05.201
You don't need to do anything.

01:38:05.203 --> 01:38:07.335
Step aside, Papi!

01:38:07.337 --> 01:38:08.573
I'm not gonna die
for that guy.

01:38:10.475 --> 01:38:12.277
Last chance, Papi.
Step aside!

01:38:14.578 --> 01:38:16.547
I don't know about you,
I'm going home!

01:39:11.603 --> 01:39:12.735
Stop!

01:39:12.737 --> 01:39:14.536
Stop!

01:39:14.538 --> 01:39:16.407
Enough!
That's enough!

01:39:17.675 --> 01:39:19.244
That's enough.

01:39:21.845 --> 01:39:22.911
Enough.

01:41:44.855 --> 01:41:46.390
Welcome.

01:41:51.762 --> 01:41:53.662
I was traveling
with two other men.

01:41:53.664 --> 01:41:55.533
They are
being cared for.

01:42:00.537 --> 01:42:02.405
Where are we?

01:42:02.407 --> 01:42:04.543
This is Colombia.

01:42:07.545 --> 01:42:08.947
We know where
you've come from.

01:42:12.449 --> 01:42:14.786
But you need only repent.

01:42:15.886 --> 01:42:19.323
Allow God back
into your life...

01:42:20.957 --> 01:42:22.994
and you'll be forgiven.

01:42:25.363 --> 01:42:27.396
You should go
and wash yourself.

01:42:27.398 --> 01:42:29.835
Then come
and pray with us.

01:43:53.417 --> 01:43:55.086
We need to keep movin'.

01:44:00.925 --> 01:44:02.694
They know
where we came from.

01:44:05.496 --> 01:44:07.565
Our deal is done.

01:44:09.065 --> 01:44:11.802
I told you
we couldn't trust him.

01:44:15.907 --> 01:44:17.641
I'm leaving.

01:44:20.511 --> 01:44:22.414
With or without you.

01:44:40.931 --> 01:44:42.400
Good luck.

01:44:54.612 --> 01:44:56.778
Papi!
We made it!

01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:58.513
Papi.

01:44:58.515 --> 01:45:00.014
It's paradise here.

01:45:00.016 --> 01:45:01.685
Yeah, but it's not home.

01:45:03.688 --> 01:45:05.056
Not for me, anyway.

01:45:07.524 --> 01:45:08.859
Good luck, Maturette.

01:46:21.164 --> 01:46:22.667
We're leaving.

01:46:23.833 --> 01:46:25.166
Now.

01:46:25.168 --> 01:46:27.072
Come on.

01:46:28.738 --> 01:46:30.171
- Aah!
- Papi!

01:46:30.173 --> 01:46:31.775
Maturette!

01:46:42.185 --> 01:46:43.818
Repent.

01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:45.853
If you are truly sorry
for what you have done,

01:46:45.855 --> 01:46:47.623
then you have
nothing to fear.

01:46:47.625 --> 01:46:49.594
God will watch over you.

01:46:57.702 --> 01:46:59.237
You came back.

01:47:33.671 --> 01:47:35.106
Come on, Papi.

01:48:01.332 --> 01:48:03.635
I had to come
and see this for myself.

01:48:05.069 --> 01:48:07.305
Few men survive
five years in solitary.

01:48:15.179 --> 01:48:16.948
What were you
living for?

01:48:19.949 --> 01:48:22.319
'Cause I don't think you're gonna
find it where you're going...

01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:27.659
Devil's Island.

01:50:34.484 --> 01:50:38.789
Now, what's the son of two school
teachers doing in a place like this?

01:51:17.328 --> 01:51:18.496
Well?

01:51:20.331 --> 01:51:21.532
What do you think?

01:51:25.402 --> 01:51:27.372
I've had five years
to work on it.

01:51:29.073 --> 01:51:32.941
The warden wasn't very happy
with my disobedience.

01:51:32.943 --> 01:51:36.544
So he sent me straight here
to Devil's Island.

01:51:51.996 --> 01:51:54.032
Let's get some food in you.

01:52:11.047 --> 01:52:12.550
Rise and shine.

01:52:15.185 --> 01:52:16.120
Come on.

01:52:17.354 --> 01:52:19.457
There's work to be done.

01:53:31.095 --> 01:53:32.963
Can we get to the ocean?

01:53:42.739 --> 01:53:44.309
I know what you're thinking.

01:53:47.110 --> 01:53:48.947
But even if you survive
the fall...

01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:52.984
you'll never survive
the ocean.

01:55:07.323 --> 01:55:08.456
Hmm?

01:55:08.458 --> 01:55:10.525
It's all about the waves.

01:55:10.527 --> 01:55:12.460
What?

01:55:12.462 --> 01:55:14.262
What are you talking about?

01:55:14.264 --> 01:55:16.665
What do you think
I'm talkin' about?

01:55:16.667 --> 01:55:18.467
Oh, go back to bed.

01:55:18.469 --> 01:55:19.867
That's suicide, not escape.

01:55:19.869 --> 01:55:22.137
No. Listen.

01:55:22.139 --> 01:55:25.607
All we need to do is build a
raft and get it to the ocean.

01:55:25.609 --> 01:55:28.379
The tide will take us
straight to the mainland.

01:55:31.582 --> 01:55:33.748
Just come and see.

01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:35.086
Come and see!

01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:56.370
See?

01:55:56.372 --> 01:55:58.141
We ride the current
to freedom.

01:58:14.511 --> 01:58:18.045
I'm a little concerned about your
ability to protect me right now.

01:58:18.047 --> 01:58:20.548
Don't worry. The fall
will probably kill us.

01:58:24.688 --> 01:58:26.390
Let's tie these together.

01:58:38.601 --> 01:58:39.970
I need to stay.

01:58:48.078 --> 01:58:49.947
What are you talking about?

01:58:54.484 --> 01:58:56.287
I need to stay.

01:58:58.055 --> 01:59:00.791
For the same reason
you have to go.

01:59:02.926 --> 01:59:04.562
I belong here.

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:11.702
It's okay.

01:59:15.404 --> 01:59:16.573
It's good.

01:59:50.506 --> 01:59:52.609
Go on now. You don't wanna
waste any more time.

02:01:45.855 --> 02:01:47.724
Louis!

02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:51.729
Louis!

02:01:54.497 --> 02:01:56.433
Louis!

02:01:59.034 --> 02:02:02.172
I made it,
you dirty little forger!

02:02:05.175 --> 02:02:06.808
Whoo!

02:02:06.810 --> 02:02:08.776
Whoo-hoo!

02:02:11.981 --> 02:02:14.150
Whoo!

02:03:10.273 --> 02:03:11.809
Thank you.

02:03:16.112 --> 02:03:17.210
Sir?

02:03:17.212 --> 02:03:18.681
Your water.

02:03:20.216 --> 02:03:22.086
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:03:28.358 --> 02:03:31.159
I'm surprised
you risked coming back.

02:03:31.161 --> 02:03:34.195
I'd read
the statute of limitations.

02:03:34.197 --> 02:03:35.699
You're still a wanted man.

02:03:36.733 --> 02:03:38.135
I won't be here long.

02:03:40.337 --> 02:03:42.239
My home is Venezuela now.

02:03:44.006 --> 02:03:47.608
But it's important

02:03:47.610 --> 02:03:49.579
that my memoir
be published here...

02:03:50.814 --> 02:03:52.182
in France.

02:04:18.942 --> 02:04:21.779
My wife convinced me
to write it all down...

02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:25.883
while I'm still young enough
to remember.

02:04:30.753 --> 02:04:32.756
So is this really your story?

02:04:41.163 --> 02:04:43.032
It's the story of
a lot of men.

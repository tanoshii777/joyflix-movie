Right!

Don't worry,

is healthy.

00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:50.158
Me and my brothers used to
do this kind of thing
all the time.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.860
Tom, your brothers are lunatics
and neither of them
were born with the power

00:04:52.994 --> 00:04:55.462
to trigger a global
cataclysmic event.

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:57.231
That's a fair point.
Did you hear that, boys?

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.599
No cataclysmic events, okay?

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:00.268

It's your "Earth Day Birthday."

was just a distraction,

00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:42.370

by the way--

00:06:42.503 --> 00:06:43.537
Good try, though--

00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:45.640

You know, the day you came
to this planet

00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:56.217

changed forever.

Wow. You know, I drew that
on my first night on Earth.

00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:03.150
I wanted to remember
where I came from.

00:08:05.353 --> 00:08:06.821
I still miss her.

00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:10.591
You think Longclaw
would be proud of me?

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:12.893
I know she would, pal.

00:08:13.027 --> 00:08:16.063
Because even though you lost her
at such a young age,

00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:19.767
you didn't let your pain
change who you are...

00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:21.669
in here.

00:08:23.404 --> 00:08:25.272
Yeah. In my lungs.

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.509
Or your heart.
Heart, right.

00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:30.111
Yeah, makes more sense.
Not lungs, heart.

about life, Sonic,

we make.

You're gonna
make some good ones and,

00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:39.086
knowing you,
you're gonna make some bad ones.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.221
But...

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:44.025
as long as you remember
to listen to your heart,

00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:46.794
you're gonna
make the right choice
when it matters the most.

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:48.129

[people screaming]
[Knuckles] What happened here?

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:58.279
[Sonic] Looks like GUN
got their butts kicked.

00:12:58.412 --> 00:13:00.881
Keep your eyes open.
Tails, anything?

00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:03.652
Whoa! These energy readings
are off the charts!

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:05.352

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:07.955

Whoa! Are you guys seeing this?

00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:30.844
He looks just like you.
Impossible!

00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:32.714
You're a colorful bunch.

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:36.150
Um, excuse me.
Why do you look like me?

00:13:36.283 --> 00:13:37.818
I don't look like you.

00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:40.588
You look like me!
Why do you look like me?

00:13:40.722 --> 00:13:44.726
Hey, you know what?
I'll ask the questions,
new hedgehog!

00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:46.860
Who are you?
Why do you look like me?

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:48.862
This is a waste of time.

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:51.700
Walk away,
before you get hurt.

00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:53.535
Whoa, whoa, easy, buddy.

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:56.337
We don't want to fight you.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.239
Actually, Sonic,
I would like to fight.

00:13:59.373 --> 00:14:00.941
Not now.
[Knuckles growls]

00:14:01.075 --> 00:14:02.876
Why don't you stop throwing cars
at us for a second

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.345
and come down here to talk?

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:07.147
You jumped
out of a GUN helicopter.

00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:09.483
There's nothing
to talk about.

00:14:09.617 --> 00:14:11.519
All right, then. Enough!

00:14:11.653 --> 00:14:12.821
Knuckles, no!

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:15.856

Knuckles, are you okay?

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:35.442
No, not really. Ow!

00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:39.514
[Tails] Who is this guy?

00:14:39.647 --> 00:14:40.782
He is much more impressive

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:42.784
than the hedgehog
I fought previously.

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:44.985
Dude,
I'm standing right here.

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:48.656
Now, come on!
He can't take us all at once.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.625
[Tails] Ow!

Sonic, I know that look.

00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:15.784
Going after him
is a bad idea.

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:18.352
When has that ever stopped me?

00:15:21.589 --> 00:15:24.024
I got to ask,
one hedgehog to another,

00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:25.426
who does your highlights?

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.460

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:55.389

00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:57.592
the harder
I want to hit you.

00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:02.957
Are you okay?

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.025
I'm fine, guys.
And before you ask,

00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:07.060
I handcuffed myself
for tactical reasons

00:17:07.194 --> 00:17:08.997
that I do not have time
to explain.

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:11.031
You shouldn't have gone off
on your own.

00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:12.700
We're supposed to be a team.

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:15.469
Sorry, buddy.
I'm still working
on this teamwork thing.

00:17:15.603 --> 00:17:16.771
So now what?

00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:19.273
Well, I'm not jumping
out of any more helicopters

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:21.408
until we get some answers
from GUN.

00:17:21.543 --> 00:17:23.443
We need somewhere to regroup.

00:17:24.846 --> 00:17:26.480
I know just the place.

Shadow's story
began a lot like yours, Sonic.

00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:15.162
But where you found family
and friends on this planet,

00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:18.933
Shadow found only pain and loss.

00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:21.769
It begins over 50 years ago,

with a meteor crash
in a quiet corner of Oklahoma.

00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:29.309
The meteorite contained
a life-form.

00:18:31.879 --> 00:18:33.715
The ultimate life-form.

00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:38.086
Shadow's power--
his "chaos energy"--

00:18:38.218 --> 00:18:41.455
went far beyond
any living creature.

00:18:43.691 --> 00:18:46.360
The scientist
who discovered him
believed this power

00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:48.863
would usher in a new era
for humanity.

00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:53.601
But Shadow's power
proved too dangerous.

00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:58.305
A terrible accident
destroyed the lab,

00:18:58.438 --> 00:19:00.407

...Shadow was a loose end
no one knew how to deal with.

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:13.353
Too dangerous
to be walking free,

00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:15.957
too valuable to destroy.

00:19:16.791 --> 00:19:19.393
So I had him placed
into stasis...

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:24.164
indefinitely.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.770
Wait a second. If Shadow's
been on ice for 50 years,

00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:31.338
someone had to help him escape.
True.

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:33.206
But there's only a few people
in the world

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.475

of Shadow's existence.

[shrieking]

00:24:29.403 --> 00:24:31.672
Doctor,
we have visitors.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.809
Really?

00:24:34.942 --> 00:24:37.712
I thought I was having
an anthropomorphic nightmare.

00:24:37.845 --> 00:24:39.447
Where the only person
I could trust in the world

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.215
showed up with
all my worst enemies,

00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:42.883
while I was in a bathrobe,

00:24:43.017 --> 00:24:45.453
playing congas
on my big, fat belly!

00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:46.821
Sorry, sir.

00:24:46.954 --> 00:24:49.256
I don't believe it.
Eggman's alive?

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.659
And he's never
looked worse.

00:24:51.792 --> 00:24:54.028
[cackling] Well, maybe,

00:24:54.161 --> 00:24:58.065
this is what not giving a damn
what you think
I look like looks like.

00:24:58.199 --> 00:25:01.836
Sir, right now we have
an even bigger problem.

00:25:01.969 --> 00:25:03.270
Oh, come on.

00:25:05.139 --> 00:25:07.608
There's an imposter out there
using your technology.

00:25:07.742 --> 00:25:11.212
Imposter.
That's impossi-- What?

00:25:11.345 --> 00:25:12.713
No.

00:25:12.847 --> 00:25:16.884
My sweet mechanized spawn!

00:25:17.018 --> 00:25:20.755
Whomever this party-pooping
posse is looking for

00:25:20.888 --> 00:25:23.090
has stolen my persona

00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:26.961
and the precious babies
from my egg sac.

00:25:27.495 --> 00:25:28.863
Well...

00:25:28.996 --> 00:25:33.534
I'll soon egg-xact
my revenge.

00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:35.169
You see what I did there?
[chuckles]

00:25:35.302 --> 00:25:38.706
It's time for the dramatic
soap-opera twist,

00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:42.943
where this Pablo
reveals his Juan!

00:25:43.077 --> 00:25:46.981
By cross-referencing
the precise coordinates

00:25:47.114 --> 00:25:50.151
of each drone's
energy spikes,

00:25:50.718 --> 00:25:52.820
I can track my babies

00:25:52.953 --> 00:25:55.656
to the imposter's
base of operations,

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.324
right about...

00:25:57.458 --> 00:25:58.325
there!

00:25:58.459 --> 00:26:00.027
Sonic, I hate to say it,

00:26:00.161 --> 00:26:02.296
but I think we're both
after the same person.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.999
Hold on, hold on.
You're not suggesting
we team up

00:26:05.132 --> 00:26:07.601
with Doctor Ro-Butt-Stink,
are you?

00:26:07.735 --> 00:26:09.070
Perhaps the fox is right.

00:26:09.203 --> 00:26:12.339
It could be our only chance
to find this mysterious,

00:26:12.473 --> 00:26:14.008
more impressive hedgehog.

00:26:14.141 --> 00:26:15.042
[groans]

00:26:15.176 --> 00:26:17.445
All right, Egghead.
I hate to say it,

00:26:17.578 --> 00:26:19.246
but it looks like
we're partners.

00:26:20.347 --> 00:26:22.283
On one condition.

00:26:23.651 --> 00:26:26.320
Dude, you have serious issues.

00:26:26.454 --> 00:26:27.755
Ow!

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.258
[gibbering spasm]

00:26:31.392 --> 00:26:32.760
Let's...

do this!

But sir, I don't have
the proper materials.

00:27:13.767 --> 00:27:15.269
Found some.

00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:19.039
Resourceful.

Oh, it's okay.

Oh, do you know
where my room is?

00:28:11.091 --> 00:28:12.760
Yeah, down the hall
and to the right.

00:28:12.893 --> 00:28:14.529
Make yourself at home.

00:28:14.663 --> 00:28:15.796
But, um,

let's lose the skates,
okay, kiddo?

00:28:18.132 --> 00:28:19.700
Okay.

Wow.

Look at all those stars.

00:31:29.858 --> 00:31:31.959
They're like diamonds.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.062
My grandfather says

00:31:35.195 --> 00:31:36.930
it can take hundreds of years

00:31:37.064 --> 00:31:39.299
for the light of a star
to reach Earth.

00:31:39.868 --> 00:31:41.770
And by the time you see it,

00:31:41.902 --> 00:31:44.371
the star might not even
exist anymore.

Isn't that crazy?

00:31:54.181 --> 00:31:56.283
Yeah, it does.

00:31:57.918 --> 00:31:59.687
I wonder which one
you came from, Shadow.

I don't know.

Maria,

00:32:17.672 --> 00:32:19.440
do you think I'm...

00:32:20.407 --> 00:32:21.609
dangerous?

00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:24.445
What are you talking about?

00:32:24.579 --> 00:32:27.247
The way the scientists
look at me,

00:32:27.381 --> 00:32:28.917
I can tell they're afraid.

00:32:29.049 --> 00:32:33.187

from that movie we watched.

anything you want.

Not because of your powers,

00:32:51.338 --> 00:32:55.142

in here.

00:32:57.545 --> 00:33:00.147

without you.

00:33:53.701 --> 00:33:54.969
It's too much.

00:33:55.102 --> 00:33:58.706
And that is why
we have to punish them.

and you don't like me.

over with quickly.

Really clever.

I'll need a moment to calculate
the molecular density

00:34:24.064 --> 00:34:25.767
and invert
the venting mechanics.

What is this place?

[Sonic] It looks like
a military base,

00:34:51.158 --> 00:34:53.027
but nobody's been here
for years.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.461
I wonder if it's haunted.

Haunted? Nobody said anything
about being haunted.

There is no such thing
as a friendly ghost.

[Sonic]
So which way do we go?

00:35:16.483 --> 00:35:20.021
I know! We should split up.

00:35:20.153 --> 00:35:23.791
Everyone with hideous,
brightly-colored fur
take the left and the middle.

00:35:23.925 --> 00:35:25.392
Stone and I will go right.

00:35:25.526 --> 00:35:27.327
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

00:35:27.461 --> 00:35:29.296
Tails, you and Stone go left.

00:35:29.429 --> 00:35:32.734
Knuckles, you take the middle.
Eggman, you and me go right.

00:35:32.867 --> 00:35:34.569
By all means.

00:35:34.702 --> 00:35:36.303
We could use some
time together.

00:35:36.436 --> 00:35:37.905
To work on
your trust issues.

00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:40.908
You know what? You're right.
I should be more trusting.

00:35:41.042 --> 00:35:44.344
I mean, you've only tried
to kill me twice!

00:35:46.146 --> 00:35:48.315
Just a dark, creepy hallway.

00:35:48.448 --> 00:35:50.450
Nothing to be afraid of.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.788
You hear that, ghost?

00:35:53.921 --> 00:35:55.355
You don't frighten me!

Boo.
[screams]

00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:10.270
I'm just gonna
come right out and say this:

00:36:10.404 --> 00:36:13.007
You're adorable.
[chuckles]
Oh, um, thanks.

00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:16.711
So, what's it like
being Sonic's assistant?

00:36:16.844 --> 00:36:20.081
You have a daily routine?
Paid time off? Benefits?

00:36:20.213 --> 00:36:23.584
Oh, I'm not Sonic's assistant.
We're teammates.

He's the leader,
Knuckles is the muscle,

00:36:26.087 --> 00:36:27.522
and I'm the gadget guy.

00:36:27.655 --> 00:36:29.157
We all have a role to play.

00:36:29.289 --> 00:36:30.858
That's what makes the team
so special!

00:36:30.992 --> 00:36:33.260
That and the fact
we're best friends.

00:36:33.828 --> 00:36:34.829
You are?

00:36:34.962 --> 00:36:37.297
Well, yeah.
Just like you and Eggman, right?

00:36:38.933 --> 00:36:40.968
Uh... Yeah, eh...

00:36:41.102 --> 00:36:43.104
Of course! Yes.

00:36:43.236 --> 00:36:46.373
Me and the doctor,
best of friends.

00:36:47.508 --> 00:36:49.177
That's definitely
what we are.

Hmm.

00:37:00.387 --> 00:37:02.422
[both screaming]

00:37:14.468 --> 00:37:17.905
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.

00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:21.609
This was more than
just a military base or a lab.

00:37:22.043 --> 00:37:23.376
It was a home.

00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:25.412
People lived here.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.481
He had a family.

00:37:28.049 --> 00:37:29.684
Is that what I smell?

00:37:29.817 --> 00:37:32.887

00:48:49.963 --> 00:48:51.265
relaxed, you know?
Clearheaded.

00:48:51.398 --> 00:48:53.868
Mmm, look at all these
new interests we found.

00:48:54.001 --> 00:48:55.770
I know, so many hobbies.
So many!

00:48:55.904 --> 00:48:59.006
After the action and adventure
of the last few years,

00:48:59.139 --> 00:49:01.543
well, I could get used to this.
Same.

00:49:01.676 --> 00:49:03.678
[deep rumbling]

00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:09.383
[Sonic] Tom! Maddie!
We need your help on a super--

00:49:09.517 --> 00:49:12.620
Knuckles, do you mind?
Oh! Excuse me.

00:49:12.754 --> 00:49:14.087
Tom! Maddie! We need your help

00:49:14.221 --> 00:49:15.857
on a super-dangerous
top-secret mission!

00:49:16.023 --> 00:49:17.257
Hmm.

00:49:18.593 --> 00:49:20.327
Thank God. Yeah, we're in.
Let's go.

00:49:20.461 --> 00:49:22.630
Really? You're in?
Just like that?

00:49:22.764 --> 00:49:25.800
Yes. It was getting so boring
without you guys here.
Yeah. So...

00:49:25.934 --> 00:49:27.434
No offense.
...boring. No, none taken.

00:49:27.569 --> 00:49:29.169
I mean, whatever crazy plan
you're cooking up,

00:49:29.303 --> 00:49:30.538
the answer's yes.
Yes.

00:49:30.672 --> 00:49:33.875
Great. But first things first:
What is that?

00:49:34.007 --> 00:49:35.375
Oh! This is...

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:37.077
[in puppet voice]
...Li'l Tom!

00:49:37.211 --> 00:49:38.813
[normal voice]
Isn't he great?

00:49:40.013 --> 00:49:42.416
I told you
to get rid of that.
It's very creepy.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:43.918
[puppet voice]
I told him to get rid of you.

00:49:44.051 --> 00:49:45.352
[normal voice]
Okay, that's, mmm...

00:49:45.486 --> 00:49:48.121
crossing a line there.
You are in so much trouble.

00:49:49.724 --> 00:49:52.760
Okay, this is it.
The belly of the beast.

00:49:52.894 --> 00:49:54.863
GUN Headquarters in London.

00:49:54.995 --> 00:49:58.198
[gasps] Tom, we're finally gonna
get to see London together.

00:49:58.332 --> 00:50:00.300
Hey, I told you we'd
get there someday, baby.

00:50:00.434 --> 00:50:02.202
Okay. So here's the plan.

00:50:02.336 --> 00:50:04.371
I run in superfast,

00:50:04.506 --> 00:50:06.708
fly over that water,
no problem,

00:50:06.841 --> 00:50:08.308
and right when I get to the--

00:50:09.376 --> 00:50:11.111
[shrieks]
What just happened?

00:50:11.245 --> 00:50:12.514
Congratulations.

00:50:12.647 --> 00:50:14.649
You just got incinerated
by their energy shield.

00:50:14.782 --> 00:50:18.485
We'll need to shut it down
by planting a USB drive
in their server room

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.021
that will give me full control
over it.

00:50:21.154 --> 00:50:22.624
That's what we need you two for.

00:50:22.757 --> 00:50:24.759
Couple of badass spies,
that's what we are.

00:50:24.893 --> 00:50:26.293
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

00:50:26.426 --> 00:50:28.161
[Tails] Once we
disable the shield,

00:50:28.295 --> 00:50:30.397
you'll face the laser hall.

00:50:30.532 --> 00:50:31.766
[grunts]

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.570
These high-density bad boys
will cut you into tiny pieces.

00:50:36.704 --> 00:50:39.339
And cut those pieces
into even tinier pieces!

00:50:39.473 --> 00:50:41.543
Once again... [shrieks]

00:50:41.676 --> 00:50:43.845
Can't we just get Tom Cruise
to do this?
[Tails] Nope.

00:50:43.978 --> 00:50:47.916
Because not even he
could break into... the vault.

00:50:48.048 --> 00:50:49.383
[Sonic]
Why is it empty in there?

00:50:49.517 --> 00:50:50.852
[Tails]
Because we have no idea

00:50:50.985 --> 00:50:52.587
what's on the other side
of that door.

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.088
To prevent the vault from ever
being accessed by a ring,

00:50:55.222 --> 00:50:58.425
all images and schematics have
been wiped from GUN's database.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.828
So for the last leg
of this heist...

00:51:01.796 --> 00:51:04.231
[in puppet voice]
...we're going in blind.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:09.704
Sorry.

00:51:09.837 --> 00:51:11.471
[Maddie] Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

00:51:11.606 --> 00:51:13.908
It sounds like this plan would
work a heck of a lot better

00:51:14.042 --> 00:51:17.912
if Sonic used the Master Emerald
to go Golden God mode

00:51:18.046 --> 00:51:19.446
to get the key.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.683
No way, Maddie.

00:51:21.816 --> 00:51:23.785
The Master Emerald
is too powerful
to ever use again.

00:51:23.918 --> 00:51:26.386
We made a promise to each other
to keep it hidden.

00:51:26.521 --> 00:51:28.856
In a location
only Knuckles knows.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.925
As guardian
of the Master Emerald,

00:51:31.059 --> 00:51:34.161
anyone who tries
to take it away
for any reason...

00:51:34.294 --> 00:51:36.764
will become a sworn enemy.

00:51:36.898 --> 00:51:38.465
Okay, okay! Sheesh!

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.300
No need to get
all growly on me, buddy.

00:51:40.434 --> 00:51:43.538
You guys are always telling us
to make good choices.

00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:45.707
Well, this is the right choice.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.274
Okay.

00:51:47.407 --> 00:51:49.644
I guess
we're going to...

00:51:49.777 --> 00:51:53.581
["London Town"
by Mr Eazi playing]

00:52:05.325 --> 00:52:07.427
London, baby!

00:52:10.397 --> 00:52:12.800
GUN Headquarters
is right there.

00:52:12.934 --> 00:52:17.137
Let me go in, get the key
and destroy anyone in my way!

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:18.940
I want revenge.

00:52:19.073 --> 00:52:20.340
[Gerald]
Patience, Shadow.

00:52:20.474 --> 00:52:22.910
Just let us handle this...

00:52:23.678 --> 00:52:27.147
and I promise
you'll have revenge

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:31.085
on a scale you couldn't
possibly imagine.

00:52:31.218 --> 00:52:34.221
Come on, Granddaddy-O,
we've got...

00:52:34.354 --> 00:52:35.623
dirt to do!

00:52:35.757 --> 00:52:37.592
Suits.

00:52:37.725 --> 00:52:38.726
Right here, sir.

00:52:39.527 --> 00:52:41.428
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

00:52:41.562 --> 00:52:44.364
Keep the crab on a low boil.

00:52:45.265 --> 00:52:47.735
It's time
for more family bonding.

00:52:52.339 --> 00:52:53.708
Come on, Shadow.

00:52:53.841 --> 00:52:58.245
Got fresh avocados in the crab.
We'll make guac.

00:52:59.814 --> 00:53:01.683
Revenge guac!

00:53:09.157 --> 00:53:13.661
Guys, are you ready for me yet?
I've been waiting here all day.

00:53:16.263 --> 00:53:19.133
Sonic,
we literally just started.

00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:21.435
Tom, Maddie,
are you in position and ready?

00:53:21.569 --> 00:53:23.671
We were born ready.
Let's do this.

00:53:23.805 --> 00:53:25.205
[Tails]
Knuckles, how about you?

00:53:25.338 --> 00:53:27.441
I have taken my perch
atop the giant clock.

00:53:27.575 --> 00:53:30.310
Now, where is this glass
I'm supposed to break?

00:53:30.444 --> 00:53:31.813
Actually, Knucks, your job

00:53:31.946 --> 00:53:34.649
is to "Break Glass
in Case of Emergency."

00:53:34.782 --> 00:53:35.950
Understood.

00:53:36.084 --> 00:53:39.486
I will shatter this glass
like the jaw of a vile foe.

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.556
In case of emergency.

00:53:41.689 --> 00:53:44.458
I will pulverize it like
the skull of a loathsome rival!

00:53:44.592 --> 00:53:47.895
Just to be clear,
the "emergency"
is the important part.

00:53:48.029 --> 00:53:49.530
The glass will beg for mercy

00:53:49.664 --> 00:53:52.133
under the shadow
of my mighty fist!

00:53:52.265 --> 00:53:53.835
Guys, remember,
we're a team.

00:53:53.968 --> 00:53:55.235
Let's focus.
Please.

00:53:55.368 --> 00:53:56.504
[Sonic] You know what?
Let's move on.

00:53:56.637 --> 00:53:58.506
All right,
everyone knows what to do.

00:53:58.639 --> 00:54:00.708
Tom and Maddie,
you guys plant the USB drive.

00:54:00.842 --> 00:54:03.477
I'll disable the traps.
Sonic will snag the launch key.

00:54:03.611 --> 00:54:05.412
And Knuckles, you stand by to--

00:54:05.546 --> 00:54:08.049
Break glass in case
of emergency.

00:54:08.182 --> 00:54:09.349
See? He gets it.

00:54:09.483 --> 00:54:10.985
Then we're all set.

00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:12.787
Hologram time.

00:54:14.222 --> 00:54:15.388
You go first.

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:18.793
Tom, it's me, Rachel!

00:54:18.926 --> 00:54:20.795
Can you believe it?
We're both in London together.

00:54:20.928 --> 00:54:22.997
Have you met your sister?
Try again.

00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:24.165
Unless...

00:54:24.297 --> 00:54:25.900
you're not
up for this mission.

00:54:26.033 --> 00:54:28.435
Yeah, maybe you want
to be back in Green Hills,
baking sourdough.

00:54:28.569 --> 00:54:30.303
Thomas Michael Wachowski!
Gah!

00:54:30.437 --> 00:54:31.773
You brought aliens
to my wedding,

00:54:31.906 --> 00:54:33.775
punched out my husband
and buried me in an avalanche.

00:54:33.908 --> 00:54:36.077
Your day of reckoning
is at hand!

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:37.211
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:54:37.344 --> 00:54:39.914
Okay, now for
her better half.

00:54:41.281 --> 00:54:46.353
Ho-ho, my name is Randall,
and I am too much to handle!

00:54:46.486 --> 00:54:47.989
Welcome to the gun show!

00:54:48.122 --> 00:54:51.391
Baby, would you describe me
as jacked, juiced,

00:54:51.526 --> 00:54:53.694
or shredded?

00:54:53.828 --> 00:54:55.563
I would describe your head
as swollen.

00:54:55.696 --> 00:54:57.297
Let's get to work.

00:55:00.568 --> 00:55:02.069
Agent Randall Handel.

00:55:02.203 --> 00:55:04.939
I'm here to have lunch
with my lovely wife, Rachel.

00:55:05.072 --> 00:55:06.541
[desk guard]
I'm sorry, Agent Handel,

00:55:06.674 --> 00:55:09.110
this facility's
currently locked down.

00:55:09.243 --> 00:55:10.945
Command-level
clearance only.

00:55:11.078 --> 00:55:13.080
One minute.

00:55:13.815 --> 00:55:16.017
Tails... we have a problem here.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:19.287
Wow, they must have
tightened security
after Shadow's escape.

00:55:19.419 --> 00:55:21.022
I got this.

00:55:22.056 --> 00:55:23.490
You must be new here.

00:55:23.624 --> 00:55:26.326
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Rachel.

00:55:26.459 --> 00:55:27.995
Rachel Gonnagetyoufired.

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.698
Do you know what GUN
stands for?

00:55:30.832 --> 00:55:33.366
Well, 'course. Guardian Units--
[mimics buzzer]

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.170
Getting. Ultra. Nasty.

00:55:36.304 --> 00:55:38.906
Do you want me...

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.975
to get ultra nasty?

00:55:41.909 --> 00:55:43.077
Nasty nasty?

00:55:43.211 --> 00:55:44.645
No, ma'am.
Okay, then.

00:55:44.779 --> 00:55:46.514
Then go ahead and take
those little sad fingers

00:55:46.647 --> 00:55:48.216
and start tippity
type-type-typing!

00:55:48.348 --> 00:55:51.185
Mm-hmm.
That's right, go on.

00:55:52.119 --> 00:55:53.888
Sorry for the inconvenience,
ma'am.

00:55:54.021 --> 00:55:55.156
Mm-hmm.

00:55:55.756 --> 00:55:57.925
That's what I thought!

00:56:00.862 --> 00:56:03.664
My God,
I love being Rachel!

00:56:13.608 --> 00:56:15.977
Did it work?
Oh, yeah.

00:56:16.476 --> 00:56:18.246
Oh! Ouch!

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.749
Director Rockwell seeking
access to the server room.

00:56:21.883 --> 00:56:23.284
Just one moment, ma'am.

00:56:24.285 --> 00:56:27.188
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
It's her. It's the real her!

00:56:27.321 --> 00:56:29.056
The incident in Colorado?
We're still assessing.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:30.625
What do you mean,
we're still assessing?

00:56:30.758 --> 00:56:32.860
What do we do?
Quick, change faces!

00:56:32.994 --> 00:56:34.095
Okay. Did it work?

00:56:34.228 --> 00:56:35.997
Who am I? What's going on?

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:38.900
Why are you looking
at me like that?
What am I doing wrong?

00:56:39.367 --> 00:56:40.835
[grunts] Ow!

00:56:41.335 --> 00:56:42.670
Aye-aye, Captain!

00:56:45.673 --> 00:56:48.809
"Aye-aye, Captain"?
Who are you, Popeye?

00:56:48.943 --> 00:56:50.978
I panicked! I was panicking!
Jeez!

00:56:51.112 --> 00:56:52.479
Get it together!

00:56:55.917 --> 00:56:57.251
Okay, Tails,
what are we looking for?

00:56:57.385 --> 00:57:00.888
The security server is
in the 7th row, 23rd cabinet.

00:57:01.022 --> 00:57:05.693
Are you guys finished yet?
This is taking forever.

00:57:05.826 --> 00:57:07.929
[people exclaiming]
[Sonic] Uh-oh.

00:57:08.062 --> 00:57:10.331
Has the time come
to break the glass?

00:57:10.463 --> 00:57:12.133
Or at least break something?

00:57:12.266 --> 00:57:14.568
All right, hang tight, guys.
Maddie's about
to insert the drive.

00:57:15.169 --> 00:57:16.170
Ready?

00:57:16.304 --> 00:57:17.437
Three...

00:57:17.571 --> 00:57:18.906
two...

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.473
one...

00:57:21.909 --> 00:57:23.110
Go.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.281
It didn't work.

00:57:27.415 --> 00:57:28.549
Did you put it in
the right way?

00:57:28.683 --> 00:57:31.285
Try punching it.
Do not try punching it.

00:57:31.419 --> 00:57:32.485

didn't they?

But you came anyway.

01:23:37.952 --> 01:23:40.287
Your anger was too much.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.223
What kind of hero
abandons his friends

01:23:43.357 --> 01:23:45.627
to pursue revenge?

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.996
Abandons his family!

01:23:48.128 --> 01:23:50.598
Don't you dare talk
about my family.

01:23:50.732 --> 01:23:53.535
And here I thought
you cared for them.

01:23:53.668 --> 01:23:57.005
Especially the one...
What's his name?

01:23:57.137 --> 01:23:58.540
Tom?

I'm right here!

You didn't let your pain
change who you are...

[whimpering sigh]

01:24:48.155 --> 01:24:50.357
This is not who I am.

01:24:50.892 --> 01:24:52.392
What are you doing?

01:24:52.527 --> 01:24:55.663
You won. Take your revenge.

01:24:57.331 --> 01:24:59.667
There are no winners
with revenge.

01:25:12.914 --> 01:25:14.481
[Maria] Wow.

01:25:14.616 --> 01:25:16.416
[voice echoing]
Look at all those stars.

01:25:17.552 --> 01:25:19.486
They're like diamonds.

01:25:21.455 --> 01:25:25.192
The last time I sat
beneath stars like this...

01:25:26.961 --> 01:25:28.630
I was with her.

01:25:30.064 --> 01:25:32.700
I've felt this pain for so long.

01:25:34.234 --> 01:25:36.004
It's all I know.

01:25:36.136 --> 01:25:38.305
When I lost Longclaw...

01:25:38.438 --> 01:25:40.440
I felt the same way.

01:25:42.043 --> 01:25:44.612
Did your pain eventually
go away?

01:25:44.746 --> 01:25:46.480
No.

01:25:46.614 --> 01:25:48.549
But in time,
I learned there's something

01:25:48.683 --> 01:25:51.151
even more powerful than pain.

01:25:51.284 --> 01:25:53.588
The love we felt for each other.

01:25:54.522 --> 01:25:56.624
That's what you need
to hold on to, Shadow.

01:25:56.758 --> 01:25:58.693
Maria might be gone,

01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:01.294

01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:33.393
This whole mess
is my fault.

01:26:33.528 --> 01:26:36.631
I've been so blinded by rage,
I thought...

01:26:37.165 --> 01:26:39.232
I had no choice.

01:26:42.402 --> 01:26:44.939
You always have a choice.

01:26:49.677 --> 01:26:52.479
But making the right one
is never easy.

01:26:52.613 --> 01:26:54.381
One more thing I learned

01:26:54.515 --> 01:26:57.350
is that when you
really screw something up,

01:26:57.484 --> 01:26:59.087
you can't fix it
on your own.

01:38:54.101 --> 01:38:57.037
[Sonic]
How about just "team"?

01:39:05.045 --> 01:39:06.980
Goodbye, Doctor.

01:39:23.163 --> 01:39:25.633
[Sonic] Big finish.
[Knuckles] Mmm!

01:39:27.034 --> 01:39:29.604
Now that's
what I call teamwork.

01:39:29.737 --> 01:39:31.573
Okay! It's ready!

01:39:31.706 --> 01:39:33.307
[munching]

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.576
[gasps]

01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:36.210
Knuckles,
how could you?

01:39:36.343 --> 01:39:38.445
Gotta be faster than that!

01:39:39.146 --> 01:39:40.214
Give me a break.

01:39:40.347 --> 01:39:41.816
Still moving a little slow
over here.

01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:43.785
Donut Lord!
Yay!

01:39:43.918 --> 01:39:45.319
[pained groan]

01:39:45.452 --> 01:39:48.388
Okay, Knuckles, that's...
I am having the love.

01:39:48.523 --> 01:39:49.824
[barks]

01:39:49.958 --> 01:39:52.493
[Tails] Aww...
Get in here, Ozzy.

01:39:52.627 --> 01:39:54.629
It's great
to be back together.

01:39:54.762 --> 01:39:56.430
We're stronger than ever.

01:39:56.564 --> 01:39:59.333
And nothing is gonna
stand in our way.

01:40:00.367 --> 01:40:04.471
Except that one piece
of unfinished business.

01:40:13.046 --> 01:40:16.283
And way out in front, to the
surprise of absolutely no one,

01:40:16.416 --> 01:40:17.785
it's the Blue Blur!

01:40:17.919 --> 01:40:19.721
Often imitated,
never duplicated,

01:40:19.854 --> 01:40:21.021
the one, the only...

01:40:21.154 --> 01:40:21.956
[yells]

01:40:22.089 --> 01:40:23.691
Let's do this!

01:40:23.825 --> 01:40:25.960
Yeah! [laughs]

01:40:26.093 --> 01:40:29.396
[yells]
All right, boys,
try and keep up.

01:40:29.931 --> 01:40:32.065
[all cheering, whooping]

01:40:36.236 --> 01:40:39.473
["Run It"
by Jelly Roll playing]

01:42:25.513 --> 01:42:29.383
Sonic the Hedgehog
is Family Champion once again!

01:42:29.884 --> 01:42:31.151
Tails?

01:42:31.586 --> 01:42:33.220
Knuckles?

01:42:34.488 --> 01:42:37.692
Okay. Yeah, I overshot
the finish line.

01:42:41.395 --> 01:42:43.230
[electronic whirring]

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.637
[Sonic] Okay,
so how do I get back?

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.841
[weapon powering up]

01:42:54.676 --> 01:42:56.678
[beeping]

01:43:00.948 --> 01:43:02.016
[Sonic] Pro tip:

01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:03.316
If you're gonna take a shot

01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:05.787
at the fastest creature
in the universe...

01:43:08.056 --> 01:43:09.757
you'd better not miss.

01:43:13.393 --> 01:43:16.097
Um... I'm flattered
by the cosplay,

01:43:16.263 --> 01:43:17.765
but you got
a few details wrong.

01:43:17.899 --> 01:43:21.268
I can't blame you, though.
It's hard to copy perfection.

01:43:31.112 --> 01:43:33.346
That's a neat trick.

01:43:41.823 --> 01:43:43.223
[Sonic yelps]

01:43:45.059 --> 01:43:46.994
What? Who are you?

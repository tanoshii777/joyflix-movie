00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.333
No.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.583
I'm done.

00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:12.875
[music brightens]

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.791
That professor said that test
took Einstein three days. Three days!

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:18.333
Yeah, then he stole his brain.

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:21.541
You know, it's just embarrassing.
You can't go to college before me.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:24.125
No, Einstein took that test,

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:26.708
became Einstein,
then they stole his brain.

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:29.583
Chris, it doesn't matter
'cause you just aced that test.

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.083
Doesn't mean I have to go here... Uh.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.416
[music fades]

00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:34.791
Watch where you're goin', son.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.416
You must think you're real funny.

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:40.208
A robot on your shirt?

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:42.625
No, it's a cartoon.
Is that a crime now too?

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:45.000
Join humanity, son! War is coming!

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:46.000
[girl] Sorry.

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:48.916
I don't know
how you're gonna survive college.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.958
Yeah, by not going.

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:51.041
[bell tolling]

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:52.750
What are you talking about?

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:56.333
[sighs] Well, Mom and Dad would've gone
nuts if I didn't take the test,

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.666
so I took the test,
and I... I kinda wanted to see how I'd do.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.833
But... I don't know.

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:05.208
-You always know.
-I'm not ready.

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:06.916
Hey.

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:11.458
Your brain is the single
most annoying thing in my life.

00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.291
It's also the most amazing.
You can't just hide that in your room.

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:18.666
That professor said
he's never seen scores like yours.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.708
You could change the world.

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:24.875
Okay, I... I...
I'd rather do it with you around.

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.625
[poignant music playing]

00:02:26.708 --> 00:02:27.541
Aw!

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:30.208
Okay, to buy me pizza and do my laundry.

00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:34.708
It doesn't matter
if you're down the hall or on the moon,

00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:36.000
we're always connected.

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:37.916
That's actually theoretically possible.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.916
Quantum physics says
that particles can stay linked

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.541
way after they come into contact.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:45.875
And if everything exists
in a state of electricity,

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:51.041
then it's possible our consciousness
could transcend physical boundaries.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:52.708
Cool.

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:56.083
Then my particles
will come visit your particles.

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:59.000
In your dorm. [chuckles]

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:05.208

[male anchor] Hey, everybody.
MTV News from May 15th.

00:03:18.708 --> 00:03:20.083
Say it ain't so!

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:23.750
Kid Cosmo, your lovable robot friend
from Saturday morning cartoon fame,

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:25.208
well, his show's been canceled.

00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:26.500
There's trouble on the moon!

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:29.916
It seems Cosmo is the latest victim
of the fierce anti-robot sentiment

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.166
sweeping the nation.

sits down with the visionary
and rather handsome founder

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.458
of Sentre Technologies.

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.708
You can't understand
the story of Ethan Skate

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:48.583
without first understanding
the story of robot evolution.

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:51.125
You famously never owned robots, did you?

00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:52.416
I never trusted them.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.875
They're not us.

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.625
So how would they possibly understand
our best interests?

00:03:57.708 --> 00:04:00.166
[man] Initially developed by Walt Disney

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.208
to promote the opening
of his theme park in 1955,

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:06.375
robots were eventually
put into mass production.

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:09.375
They quickly became the backbone
of the global workforce,

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:12.458
doing all the jobs that
humans didn't want to do.

00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:16.500
For years, they never complained
about working around the clock,

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:18.208
but the day eventually came

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:21.041
when they grew tired
of the lives we assigned them

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:23.416
and demanded lives of their own.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.500
[chef bot] Zut alors!

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:26.625
The robot rights movement
gathered steam today

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:29.375
as thousands of robots
descended on St. Louis

00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:31.125
to listen to a fiery speech

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:34.416
made by former Planters promotional bot
Mr. Peanut.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.666
We were built to think,
but now, they don't want us to.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.750
We were built to work
but never for ourselves.

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:46.333
Our destiny isn't theirs to decide.

00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:49.000
It's ours to fight for.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.208
My toaster breaks, I get a new toaster.
What if I'm...

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:57.875
-But that's murder. Do you hear yourself?
-No! Bots have an on-off switch.

00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.500
Let me finish. We have...
We deserve the right to liberty.

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:01.791
Deserve freedom from servitude.

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:04.375
They deserve the right to work for me
when I plug them in.

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:05.291
[robot] No!

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:08.041

it's off to the garbage dump.

These acts demand a strong response.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:30.583
As of today,
we are at war with the robot population,

00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:35.750
and any US citizen harboring a robot
will be met with charges of treason.

A device that linked the human mind
to mechanized drone bodies.

00:06:06.416 --> 00:06:09.166
Obviously,
I have no issue with technology

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.458
as long as humanity retains control.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.291

to fight fire with mechanized fire.

Work and play at the same time.

[Vance] Escapism for the masses.

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:24.750
I would prefer to think of it as freedom.

-Going to class.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.458
You need an after-school activity.

Child Services says they'll pay extra

why doesn't Ted tell me himself?

Uh, marching band.
Do you play an instrument?

Argh! That's a '57 Les Paul!
Do you know how hard that was to find?

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.208
You didn't find it. All this shit's looted
from the Exclusion Zone.

00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:07.958
-So?
-You're stealing. It's black market.

00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:09.208
The bots aren't using it.

00:09:09.291 --> 00:09:11.875
Besides, you can't
steal stuff nobody wants.

00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.083
That's... that's, like, uh... law.

00:09:14.166 --> 00:09:16.000

Oh. I'm sorry, I have a condition

but you go right ahead!

Tough day.

00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:58.583
I wouldn't limit it to today.

00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:01.583
Well, maybe I should have a talk
with your mom?

[softly] Oh.

00:10:19.083 --> 00:10:21.208
A lot of kids here lost family in the war.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.166
It wasn't from the bots, actually.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:26.916
Our car hit a deer.

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:30.083
-In the road.
-I'm sorry.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.583
So was the deer.

00:10:33.583 --> 00:10:36.500
You know, neurotherapy

Live by that motto, kid.

00:44:50.166 --> 00:44:51.208
That's what I do.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:55.208
-How'd you two meet?
-We actually met in the war.

00:44:55.791 --> 00:44:58.666
-Weren't you supposed to kill each other?
-[chuckles] We tried.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.416
Bots had my whole platoon surrounded,
broke my leg in two.

00:45:04.333 --> 00:45:06.958
The tin men circled up
to finish off the job.

00:45:07.041 --> 00:45:10.916
[chuckles] I look up, I see this big dumb
construction bot peering down at me.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.833
I close my eyes, get ready to die,

00:45:12.916 --> 00:45:15.750
and instead, he just lifts me up,
carries me out.

00:45:15.833 --> 00:45:20.333
-[Herm] You were cryin' like a baby.
-Ha ha ha! Yeah, right. Not like a baby.

00:45:20.416 --> 00:45:22.500
You know they don't really know
human emotion.

00:45:22.583 --> 00:45:26.750
It was a war cry.
Like, "Yeah! W... Wolverines!"

00:45:26.833 --> 00:45:30.541
Please. You were sucking your thumb
and begging me to save your ass.

00:45:30.625 --> 00:45:32.791
He's... he's correct.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.291
A few days later,

00:45:37.208 --> 00:45:39.875
well, Sentre drones found us,
and I tried to tell 'em,

00:45:39.958 --> 00:45:44.333
"Hey, this guy saved my life.
Herm's a good guy. Don't shoot."

00:45:44.416 --> 00:45:46.791
[scoffs] They opened fire anyway.

00:45:48.041 --> 00:45:49.875
Tried to kill us both, so we ran.

00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:52.875
We been runnin' ever since, huh?

00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:54.833
Most people would think
it was weird, right?

00:45:54.916 --> 00:45:57.291
A robot and a guy gettin' along.
Hangin' out.

00:45:57.375 --> 00:45:58.833
At least you have each other.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.291
[Keats] So what are you gonna do
if you find your brother?

00:46:02.375 --> 00:46:04.583
I mean, you know, the rest of him.

00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:06.166
What do you do then?

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.166
Whatever we want.

00:46:09.958 --> 00:46:11.250
[music fades]

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.375
What you makin', Mama?

00:46:16.333 --> 00:46:19.541
[woman] It's Sunday.
What do I always make on Sunday?

00:46:19.625 --> 00:46:21.125
[1940s music playing on radio]

00:46:21.208 --> 00:46:22.583
Stuffed peppers.

00:46:22.666 --> 00:46:25.250
-[woman] What my boy wants, my boy gets.
-[chuckles]

00:46:26.208 --> 00:46:29.875
As long as it's less than a nickel
and on the day-old shelf.

00:46:29.958 --> 00:46:31.333
You, hush.

00:46:31.958 --> 00:46:35.458
But, not for nothing, a cannoli.

00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:38.791
-Day old?
-Two.

00:46:39.291 --> 00:46:41.541
Mrs. Vella gave it on the house.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.125
It's good to see you like this, Mama.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:50.958
-Up and around, and...
-Why wouldn't I be?

00:46:52.916 --> 00:46:53.750
No reason.

00:46:54.916 --> 00:46:58.291
[chuckles] My angioletto.

00:46:58.375 --> 00:47:00.125
Such a funny boy.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.375
Such a funny boy.

00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:05.041
[echoing] Such a funny boy.

00:47:05.125 --> 00:47:06.708
[sound faltering]

00:47:10.083 --> 00:47:11.708
Son of a bitch!

00:47:18.458 --> 00:47:20.458
[somber music playing]

00:47:23.666 --> 00:47:26.416
[Skate] The data-transfer rate
is dropping like a rock.

00:47:27.916 --> 00:47:28.750
Explain.

00:47:28.833 --> 00:47:33.333
-Well... he told me it could wait, so...
-Uh, until I had all the facts.

00:47:33.416 --> 00:47:37.791
[Skate] The fact is that the service
we provide for the world

00:47:37.875 --> 00:47:40.208
is going from utterly flawless

00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:43.291
to complete dog shit!

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.875
Why?

00:47:47.583 --> 00:47:49.000
-Christopher's gone.
-Louder.

00:47:49.083 --> 00:47:51.541
Christopher... is... gone.

00:47:55.125 --> 00:47:56.458
That's physically impossible.

00:47:56.541 --> 00:48:00.291
But cerebrally,
n... neurologically, he... he's not there.

00:48:00.375 --> 00:48:04.500
Are you telling me
that my breakthrough broke out?

00:48:04.583 --> 00:48:08.791
[softly] There was a, uh,
tiny unsecured node in his data matrix.

00:48:08.875 --> 00:48:10.583
Barely noticeable really.

00:48:10.666 --> 00:48:14.958
And... over time,
it allowed his consciousness to, um...

00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:18.708
uh, well, drip past our firewalls.

00:48:19.583 --> 00:48:23.000
It appears that it was constructed
that way d... deliberately.

00:48:23.083 --> 00:48:24.833
-It was Amherst.
-Well, it wasn't us, sir.

00:48:24.916 --> 00:48:28.250
No. Theoretically, if the Neurocaster
data speed keeps dropping...

00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:30.291
[man] A... and there's no reason
to think it won't.

00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:32.416
Sentre is screwed eight ways to Sunday.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.541
-More like Saturday.
-[Skate] This Saturday?

00:48:34.625 --> 00:48:38.166
-My company collapses on Saturday?
-Friday, more likely.

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:39.916
-Shut up.
-[whispers] It could be Saturday.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.375
[sighs]

00:48:44.958 --> 00:48:45.958
You've got mail!

00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:04.375
[music intensifying]

00:49:07.375 --> 00:49:09.291
[Neurocaster powering up]

00:49:13.375 --> 00:49:17.250
[Skate] I... I've... I've... I've always
found the natural world very soothing.

00:49:20.416 --> 00:49:21.333
You know me?

00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.708
Who doesn't know
the Butcher of Schenectady?

00:49:24.791 --> 00:49:27.833
The baddest ass on the Task Force.

00:49:27.916 --> 00:49:31.041
I saw your puff piece
on 60 Minutes when you retired.

00:49:31.125 --> 00:49:32.458
[Butcher] I didn't retire.

00:49:33.208 --> 00:49:35.041
I just ran out of bots to hunt.

00:49:38.458 --> 00:49:42.541
I understand that you're hunting
for a juvenile delinquent

00:49:43.416 --> 00:49:46.875
and her... mechanical companion.

00:49:46.958 --> 00:49:48.958
Task Force calls, I answer.

00:49:49.041 --> 00:49:52.166
Hmm. Well, seems that
you and I share a common goal, then.

00:49:53.916 --> 00:49:57.125
The girl's machine... belongs to Sentre.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:01.666
-I want it back.
-The bot's wanted for assault.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.708
-And that's an automatic termination.
-Yeah, but you could delay that.

00:50:05.416 --> 00:50:06.833
Once Sentre has what it needs,

00:50:06.916 --> 00:50:09.166
you can do whatever you want
to whatever is left.

00:50:13.666 --> 00:50:14.833
It's a nice spot.

00:50:14.916 --> 00:50:17.125
-Thank you. Made it myself.
-I know.

00:50:17.208 --> 00:50:19.583
I saw your puff piece on 20/20.

00:50:19.666 --> 00:50:21.625
Then, you know

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.541
the incredible resources that I have.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.166
Suppose I could get
your drone back online.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:33.583
Why not go get him yourself?
Sentre's got the toys.

00:50:33.666 --> 00:50:34.666
Peace accords.

00:50:35.291 --> 00:50:37.125
Not allowed to go into the EX

00:50:37.208 --> 00:50:40.208
unless there's evidence
that the treaty has been broken.

00:50:40.291 --> 00:50:42.166
So are you asking me to get the bot?

00:50:42.958 --> 00:50:44.375
Or to get you evidence?

00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:47.500
Let's just see where the day takes us...
shall we?

00:50:48.083 --> 00:50:50.083
[apprehensive music playing]

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:00.166
[sighs]

00:51:05.083 --> 00:51:07.291
[Herm] Hey, meat puppets.
Look ahead of you.

00:51:07.916 --> 00:51:10.750
Wow! Tabletop Mountain, huh?

00:51:11.583 --> 00:51:13.541
That right there is a natural wonder.

00:51:13.625 --> 00:51:16.000
If you were this doctor,
where would you be?

00:51:16.083 --> 00:51:19.125
[Cosmo] There's a Martian base
just past the asteroid field.

00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:20.458
[Michelle] Is that a mall?

00:51:22.666 --> 00:51:26.208
Seems to be in pretty good shape.
Guess the Scavs haven't found it yet.

00:51:26.791 --> 00:51:30.416
[Keats] There's supplies,
shelter, defensible perimeter.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.291
Not the worst place in the world to hide.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.125
-Think the food court's still open?
-[Herm] Here we go.

00:51:35.208 --> 00:51:37.291
We found an old Panda Express in the EX.

00:51:37.375 --> 00:51:39.041
All the food was still good.

00:51:39.125 --> 00:51:43.375
We got fortune cookies,
General Tso's chicken, orange chicken,

00:51:43.458 --> 00:51:45.750
chicken fried rice, pork fried dumplings.

00:51:45.833 --> 00:51:47.833
All that stuff, it just doesn't go bad.

00:51:53.916 --> 00:51:55.375
[tense music fades in]

00:51:55.458 --> 00:51:56.958
-[Herm] Uh-oh.
-Look out!

00:51:58.666 --> 00:52:01.041
[Herm] That son of a bitch
threw a fridge at us!

00:52:01.125 --> 00:52:04.000
-Herm, get us outta here!
-I'm tryin'!

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.666
Incoming!

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:11.541
-Ow! Oh, he got me in the hammy! Oh no!
-[Keats groans]

00:52:12.125 --> 00:52:14.541
Hold on! Oh no, we're goin' down! No, no!

00:52:14.625 --> 00:52:15.708
[Keats] Ow!

00:52:19.416 --> 00:52:22.166
-Who throws refriger... Son of a...
-[music fades]

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:23.458
[Michelle] Huh?

00:52:24.083 --> 00:52:25.833
[tense music fading in]

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
[Keats groans] Ah, shit.

00:52:29.083 --> 00:52:30.375
[drum roll]

00:52:31.666 --> 00:52:33.500
[bot] Ladies and gentlemen...

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.958
[dramatic musical flourish]

00:52:35.041 --> 00:52:36.000
...you're captured.

00:52:39.875 --> 00:52:43.750
-[Keats] You ever seen these guys before?
-Dude, we don't all know each other.

00:52:45.041 --> 00:52:48.541
Hey, I better not see
one ding on that thing.

00:52:48.625 --> 00:52:49.500
[bot] Too late.

00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:50.750
I must ask you to halt.

00:52:51.458 --> 00:52:53.875
-Right there.
-Watch where you're stickin' that thing.

00:52:53.958 --> 00:52:56.291
Prepare yourselves
to witness the wonderment,

00:52:56.375 --> 00:52:58.083
to behold the beguiling,

00:52:58.166 --> 00:53:04.333
to perceive the prodigious
prestidigitations of Perplexo.

00:53:06.458 --> 00:53:09.750
[melodramatically]
Spirits of the netherworld, hear me!

00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:14.125
I command this gate to rise!

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.125
[bot mutters]

00:53:20.208 --> 00:53:22.916
We rehearsed this a thousand times.
Come on!

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.625
All right, now,
newly awakened spirits of the underworld!

00:53:26.708 --> 00:53:29.791
[quietly] Unbelievable.
[loudly] I command this gate to rise!

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:35.291
Are you not amazed?

00:53:36.583 --> 00:53:41.041
-Where are you taking us?
-All questions will be answered within.

00:53:46.583 --> 00:53:49.333
[bot speaking unintelligibly]

00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:53.916
-[circus music playing]
-[dog bot growls]

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.250
[Keats quietly] Here's the plan.
I'm gonna fake a seizure.

00:53:57.333 --> 00:53:58.541
You get to the roof.

00:53:58.625 --> 00:54:02.833
-I'm not leaving until I find that doctor.
-Hey, you want some juice?

00:54:02.916 --> 00:54:05.541
-[Cosmo whimpers] Don't talk to strangers!
-[Michelle] Come on.

00:54:05.625 --> 00:54:09.833
[bot cackling] Well, here if you need me.

00:54:09.916 --> 00:54:11.666
[playing ragtime music]

00:54:14.583 --> 00:54:18.458
Oh me, oh my! Taco, humans.

00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:23.708
Oh my God.

00:54:24.791 --> 00:54:26.291
This is crazy.

00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:29.500
[ice cream bot muttering]

[coins dropping into machine]

[bot 1] Ah, jeez, people.
Where the heck did they come from?

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:40.833
-[bot 2] They're prisoners.
-[bot 3] It's a Kid Cosmo bot.

00:54:41.333 --> 00:54:42.708
[bot 4] They're not human!

00:54:44.333 --> 00:54:46.166
[bot 5] Hey. Hey.

-[music intensifies]
-[giant bot groans]

00:54:57.333 --> 00:55:00.541
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to bring a very special guest

00:55:00.625 --> 00:55:01.958
onto our stage tonight.

00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:03.583
A personage so august,

00:55:03.666 --> 00:55:05.791
a leader so towering,

00:55:05.875 --> 00:55:09.625
he goes only by the awe-inspiring title of

00:55:10.208 --> 00:55:12.708
Mr. Peanut!

00:55:13.208 --> 00:55:14.541
No way.

00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:16.541
[Southern accent] Cut the guff, P.

00:55:16.625 --> 00:55:19.416
[chuckles] You know I don't care
for all that hyperbole.

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:25.166
Afternoon. I'd... I'd tip my hat,
but, uh, well, it's bolted on.

00:55:25.666 --> 00:55:29.125
We took you down
because we thought you were Scavs.

00:55:29.208 --> 00:55:32.541
-Excuse me?
-See, they come round every now and again.

00:55:32.625 --> 00:55:35.541
Just lookin' to rip us limb from limb.

00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:38.541
Y'all don't really look like limb-rippers,

00:55:38.625 --> 00:55:40.750
but, you know, looks can be deceivin'.

00:55:40.833 --> 00:55:42.500
We need to talk to you, sir.

00:55:42.583 --> 00:55:44.833
Yeah, humans always want
somethin' from us.

00:55:44.916 --> 00:55:46.875
Kinda like stink on a skunk.

00:55:46.958 --> 00:55:48.583
We're looking for a doctor.

00:55:49.541 --> 00:55:51.916
With... glasses.

00:55:53.291 --> 00:55:57.000
Mmm, well, walk with me, will ya?

00:55:58.291 --> 00:56:02.750
Stupid question, I know,
but... what exactly is this place?

00:56:02.833 --> 00:56:07.125
[Mr. Peanut] Well, uh, we haven't put up
the sign yet, but try this on for size.

00:56:07.666 --> 00:56:12.958
"Blue Sky Acres,
an oasis of safety in an uncaring desert."

00:56:13.041 --> 00:56:14.125
[Herm] Pretty catchy.

00:56:14.208 --> 00:56:17.916
You're lookin' at the cradle
of a new mechanized civilization.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.333
-Hey, Mr. Peanut.
-How do, Blitz?

00:56:20.416 --> 00:56:21.666
[Blitz] Ralphie, slow down!

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:28.041
At Blue Sky Acres, robots can evolve past
the job descriptions humans stuck on them.

00:56:28.125 --> 00:56:31.083
-They can pick up a new trade.
-Hair!

00:56:31.166 --> 00:56:34.416
-Maybe even find their true selves.
-Hair!

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:35.458
Uh-uh. Like, whoa.

00:56:35.541 --> 00:56:38.166
[Mr. Peanut] Mrs. Scissors,
we don't do that anymore.

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:40.750
-Hair.
-[Mr. Peanut] Leave the man alone, please.

00:56:40.833 --> 00:56:43.000
-[Mrs. Scissors sighs sadly]
-Oh!

00:56:43.083 --> 00:56:46.500
Sir. Mr... Peanut. We need your help.

00:56:46.583 --> 00:56:49.375
I'm sure you do, but the actual fact is

00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:52.541
your presence here
provides legal justification

00:56:52.625 --> 00:56:56.500
for Sentre to wipe out
everything these robots have built.

00:56:56.583 --> 00:57:00.708
Best I can do is escort you
ten miles into the desert

00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:02.375
and leave you on your lonesome.

00:57:03.083 --> 00:57:05.375
I mean, after chow, of course.

00:57:06.416 --> 00:57:07.250
[plastic snaps]

00:57:07.333 --> 00:57:09.750
Free as a bird!
Now, I hope you brought your appetite.

00:57:09.833 --> 00:57:12.375
I did. I never got my burrito.

00:57:12.458 --> 00:57:14.875
Hey, read the room. It's a burger joint.

00:57:14.958 --> 00:57:18.541
All right, well... I'll have a cheeseburger.

00:57:18.625 --> 00:57:20.125
Oh, sorry. We're outta cheese.

00:57:20.208 --> 00:57:22.250
That... that's fine. Burger and fries.

00:57:22.333 --> 00:57:24.625
Well, more bad news. We're outta that too.

00:57:24.708 --> 00:57:26.708
-[rock and roll plays on radio]
-What do you have?

00:57:26.791 --> 00:57:28.625
I'mma break it down to you for real.

00:57:28.708 --> 00:57:31.125
Ain't nobody ate up in here
in a long time.

00:57:31.208 --> 00:57:33.291
If it was good, it's bad now.

00:57:33.375 --> 00:57:35.958
We got spaghetti.
We got canned beans on a Twinkie.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.583
What kind of beans?

00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:45.500
So your brother has no idea
where his actual human body is?

00:57:45.583 --> 00:57:46.750
All he knows is Sentre.

00:57:46.833 --> 00:57:48.416
[jaunty music playing in background]

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:53.166
Hmm! Why in the hell
would Sentre steal a little boy?

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:54.625
I know. It's nuts.

00:57:56.875 --> 00:57:59.125
-No offense.
-Get it all the time.

00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:02.375
Chris said the doctor that took him
would be here at Tabletop.

00:58:03.166 --> 00:58:04.000
Okay.

00:58:04.875 --> 00:58:07.166
Might as well tell you the truth.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.041
[chuckles] There was a doctor here.

00:58:09.708 --> 00:58:11.208
-[Cosmo] Here we go!
-What did you say?

00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:16.208
Dr. Clark Amherst,
PhD in Human-Machine Interaction.

00:58:16.291 --> 00:58:17.416
Well, where is he now?

00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.750
[Mr. Peanut] Obviously,
I gave him the boot.

00:58:19.833 --> 00:58:21.083
At least he's consistent.

00:58:21.166 --> 00:58:23.916
You don't know any other way outta here,
and the one person who did,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.166
you sent him off in the wilderness to die?

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:27.458
Damn right I did.

00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:33.041
I signed that peace treaty
because it recognized robots as a people.

00:58:33.875 --> 00:58:36.125
I don't guess you'd know what it's like

00:58:36.208 --> 00:58:39.166
to have your very right to exist
depend on a piece of paper.

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:42.250
All this, it's fragile, man,

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:45.666
and there was no way
I was gonna let that doctor threaten it

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:47.083
any more than I'll let you.

00:58:47.166 --> 00:58:49.500
Dr. Amherst is a kidnapper.

00:58:49.583 --> 00:58:53.166
This is the little boy he took.
You gonna treat those two people the same?

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:56.833
But all humans are the same.
Selfish and lazy.

00:58:56.916 --> 00:59:00.666
Once you figure that out, little girl,
you'll live a much simpler life.

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:01.708
Come on.

00:59:02.708 --> 00:59:03.541
Young lady?

00:59:05.125 --> 00:59:07.458
I would not advise you
to go out there at night.

00:59:07.541 --> 00:59:09.500
I really don't care
about what you would advise.

00:59:09.583 --> 00:59:11.416
Think you're building
something special here?

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.333
You're just like everyone out there.

00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:15.791
Thanks for the ride.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.041
Bon appétit.

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:23.000
Keats.

00:59:23.083 --> 00:59:24.500
-What?
-[Herm] Really?

00:59:24.583 --> 00:59:27.500
-I gotta eat.
-This is lame, man. Even for you.

00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:32.416
[Keats growls]

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.166
-Where you goin'?
-There are cars in the parking lot.

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:38.041
I'll get one
and drive until I find the doctor.

00:59:38.125 --> 00:59:40.250
Come on,
it's 100,000 square miles out there.

00:59:40.333 --> 00:59:44.041
-Chances of finding them are pretty slim.
-Chances of finding him in here are zero.

00:59:44.125 --> 00:59:47.083
The chances of not dyin' in here
are pretty high.

00:59:47.166 --> 00:59:48.958
You can't go out in the EX after dark.

00:59:49.041 --> 00:59:51.250
I mean, listen,
you're just gonna have to trust me.

00:59:51.333 --> 00:59:55.125
Hey. For real.
Your sister's no good to you dead.

00:59:57.791 --> 00:59:59.000
Look at that face.

00:59:59.833 --> 01:00:03.250
How can you deny
that weird robot-head face?

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.500
Hang out!

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.333
Go to Orange Julius.

01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:08.333
It's a mall. Steal some shit.

01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:10.708
Leave in the mornin'.

01:00:14.166 --> 01:00:15.000
Fine.

01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:18.333
We'll get killed in the morning.

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:22.791
[bots muttering unintelligibly]

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:25.750
-Ah, hair!
-Touch my hair, and I'll kill you.

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:28.916
-[dejectedly] Ah, hair.
-[bot] He could use a haircut.

01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:32.625
[pensive music playing]

01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:47.291
That should just about do it, Beemo.

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:50.625
-Hot dog, Cosmo. With these upgrades...
-[Michelle] Hi, stranger!

01:00:51.333 --> 01:00:53.583
-Merry Christmas!
-Where've you been?

01:00:53.666 --> 01:00:56.500
-There's trouble on the moon!
-[Michelle] Lisa Stewart had a party.

01:00:56.583 --> 01:00:59.541
-Mom said you were at the library.
-I'm pretty sure that's what I told her.

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:00.666
You have any fun "reading"?

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:02.708
Better than here.

01:01:02.791 --> 01:01:04.125
Ever since you left,

01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:07.541
if Mom and Dad aren't yelling
at each other, they're yelling at me.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:12.250
-Good thing I'm moving home, then.
-Shut up. I'll be fine.

01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:15.458
That's super debatable,
but I wouldn't be doing it for you.

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:18.291
-What, you graduate early or something?
-Not exactly.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:20.916
My professor shows me off
like I'm some sort of prized monkey,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.208
but he never listens to my ideas,
then I get back to my dorm,

01:01:24.791 --> 01:01:29.833
and my roommate calls me Doogie Howser
and pees in my garbage can.

01:01:30.708 --> 01:01:32.875
-[snickers]
-I'm moving home.

01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:36.166
You do that,
and I'll pee in your garbage can.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:41.000
Remember when I said
you were gonna change the world?

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:42.708
I do.

01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:45.458
-Have you done that yet?
-Not exactly.

01:01:45.541 --> 01:01:48.250
Then, I suggest
you get your ass back to college.

01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:49.708
[sighs]

01:01:54.458 --> 01:01:56.083
After Christmas.

01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:57.666
[Cosmo] Cosmo modules, unite!

01:02:00.458 --> 01:02:04.125
Bet if Cosmo went to college,
Jessie would visit him all the time.

01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:06.791
[gasps] How dare you?

01:02:07.541 --> 01:02:08.833
Jessie has a jetpack.

01:02:08.916 --> 01:02:11.416
-Okay, I'll build you a jetpack.
-Fine.

01:02:11.916 --> 01:02:13.625
Deal. I'd love a jetpack.

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:19.041
-Thanks for coming, Cosmo.
-I missed you, dude.

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:20.875
[Cosmo] Always remember,
Kid Cosmo's your pal.

01:02:20.958 --> 01:02:22.041
I missed you too.

01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:25.458
[music becomes poignant]

01:02:43.583 --> 01:02:45.833
I better hurry.
There's trouble on the moon!

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:48.291
[dramatic music plays in cartoon]

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:50.416
That's no way to treat a friend.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:54.125
Hey, Webby, no snacking between meals!

01:02:54.708 --> 01:02:56.708
[tender music playing]

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.500
[bot muttering unintelligibly]

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:06.125
You can if you believe you can!

01:03:06.208 --> 01:03:08.125
[bot muttering]

01:03:08.708 --> 01:03:10.375
[music intensifies]

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:12.250
Next time, try a sandwich!

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.833
Thanks for coming, Cosmo.

01:03:16.916 --> 01:03:19.166
[Cosmo] Always remember,
Kid Cosmo's your pal.

01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:23.333
[music fades]

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:25.000
[snoring]

01:03:26.833 --> 01:03:29.041
[female whispering] Uh, hi. Hello?

01:03:31.958 --> 01:03:33.500
-Ding-dong!
-Did you hear that?

01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:34.875
[female] Oh, hi!

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:36.458
[groans] Huh?!

01:03:37.041 --> 01:03:40.666
I'm not even supposed to be here.
Um, we should be really quiet.

01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:44.041
I'm looking for a "Christopher Greene"?

01:03:44.125 --> 01:03:45.750
[Cosmo] Double asteroid!

01:03:45.833 --> 01:03:47.458
I've got some mail for you.

01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:50.791
Oh God, Herm, I got the Twinkie sweats.

01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:55.208
Just before Mr. Peanut sent him away,
Dr. Amherst gave me that letter,

01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:58.375
and he said to deliver it to Christopher
if he ever showed up.

01:03:58.458 --> 01:04:00.541
Oh, and that there...
there's no signature required.

01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:02.875
"Christopher, if you find this, find me."

01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:05.166
"2201 Pinnacle Peak Road."

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.541
"I will wait. Clark."

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:09.208
[female] I guess I already
broke the rules by taking it from him.

01:04:09.291 --> 01:04:12.000
I don't know where I'm at with this.
Guess there's no use crying over...

01:04:12.083 --> 01:04:14.916
-How can I get to this place?
-Well, I know where it is. It's not that.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.250
It's that if I help you,
I'm gonna get in even more trouble

01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:21.041
than I'd already probably get in,
and it makes me feel really bad to say it,

01:04:21.125 --> 01:04:23.083
but I... I can't tell you.

01:04:23.166 --> 01:04:25.583
But I do know. I do know.
It's not that I don't know.

01:04:25.666 --> 01:04:30.208
Look, if that's the doctor... that might be
able to get us the hell outta here,

01:04:30.291 --> 01:04:36.208
then could be your terrible idea is...
slightly less terrible.

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:37.375
We can get you there.

01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:40.958
Keats, that's Scav territory.
You know we're gonna need muscle.

01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:44.333
Muscles are antiquated and unreliable.

01:04:44.416 --> 01:04:48.708
Oh, he heard us. We were too loud.
I was too loud! It was me. I was loud.

01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:53.541
A pneumatic piston, on the other hand,
that's a quality component.

01:04:54.166 --> 01:04:57.208
And a baseball bat,
well, that'll get 'er done.

01:04:57.291 --> 01:05:01.291
-Meaning what?
-The treaty doesn't allow you to stay.

01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:03.750
That doesn't mean I can't help you leave.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.541
I thought we were the enemy.

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:09.416
Could be the human factory
made some good models after all.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.416
Thank you.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.291
Well, I was talkin' to her.

01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:18.333
Now, if we're headin' into Scav country,
there's a fella you're gonna wanna meet.

01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:22.250
[creaks]

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:27.250
Would you like to hear
a funny story about Scavs?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.791
Oh yeah! I love to laugh.

01:05:29.875 --> 01:05:32.208
I once saw a Scav hunting party

01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:36.791
attack and dismember
ten of my closest friends

01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:37.875
in front of my eyes!

01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:40.000
[splutters] How is that funny?

Thing is, he might've got me too.

You got a big hole
in your guts here, buddy.

are you still alive?

01:43:10.583 --> 01:43:13.541
How am I still alive?
I'm alive because of you, you bastard.

01:43:24.208 --> 01:43:25.875
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

01:43:25.958 --> 01:43:29.458
but our friends
are in a lot of trouble out there.

-I'm working on it.
-Uh, we may be running out of time.

-I'm not pulling your plug.
-You said you would if you had to.

01:43:37.291 --> 01:43:40.666
I don't have to. We'll find another robot.
You can use that.

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:42.583
They locked me in tight this time.

01:43:43.875 --> 01:43:47.291
-There's no choice here.
-There's always a choice.

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.416

but I couldn't.

You were all I had.

I held onto you.

01:43:56.291 --> 01:43:57.291
And it worked.

01:43:57.375 --> 01:43:58.833
I got you back.

01:43:58.916 --> 01:44:00.291
That's why this is okay.

01:44:00.375 --> 01:44:01.208
No.

But out there with you,
I felt everything, and it was awesome.

01:44:14.708 --> 01:44:15.916
And you gave me that.

01:44:18.708 --> 01:44:19.791
If that's all I get,

01:44:21.041 --> 01:44:23.791
it... it's enough. [exhales]

Hi.

My name is Michelle Greene.

I know some of you

01:51:36.958 --> 01:51:39.500

I just wanted to tell you why.

The things Sentre did,
they weren't just bad for robots.

01:51:52.791 --> 01:51:54.916
They were bad for all of us.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.750
I know the war happened.

And things fell apart,
and life really sucked.

01:52:00.791 --> 01:52:04.625
And maybe for a little while,
the Neurocasters helped you forget that.

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:09.416
We got so used to it that
we thought that that's what real life was.

-But it's not.

We're flesh and bone, yeah,
but we're also electricity.

01:52:20.375 --> 01:52:24.875
And when we hug and laugh
and hold hands and argue,

my particles stay with you,
and yours stay with me.

01:52:29.458 --> 01:52:31.625
And maybe we stay together forever.

01:52:32.458 --> 01:52:35.500
But that can't happen
if you close yourself off.

01:52:35.583 --> 01:52:39.583

out here in the real world.

Auto, why didn't you wake me

45:45.990 --> 45:48.680
Honestly, it's the one thing
I get to do on this ship.

45:57.630 --> 45:59.790
<i>Well, good morning, everybody,</i>

45:59.900 --> 46:05.530

<i>Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be
proud to know that 700 years later</i>

46:20.760 --> 46:24.420

46:24.660 --> 46:25.620
Fore!

46:25.730 --> 46:29.250
So, be sure next mealtime to ask for your "free

46:34.100 --> 46:35.430

Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button?

46:42.180 --> 46:45.200
Captain, Probe One has returned positive.

46:46.550 --> 46:47.780
Positive?

46:57.930 --> 46:58.890
EVE.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.850
But no probe's

47:16.380 --> 47:18.470
<i># Buy N Large #</i>

47:22.180 --> 47:23.340
<i>If you are seeing this,</i>

47:23.450 --> 47:27.010
<i>that means your

<i>or EVE probe, has returned from Earth</i>

47:30.560 --> 47:34.860
<i>with a confirmed specimen

47:34.960 --> 47:38.730
<i>That's right. It means it's time
to go back home.</i>

47:38.870 --> 47:41.730
Home? We're going back?

47:41.840 --> 47:45.340
<i>Now that Earth has been restored
to a life-sustaining status,</i>

47:45.440 --> 47:49.000
<i>by golly, we can begin Operation Recolonize.</i>

47:58.320 --> 48:00.380
<i>Simply follow this manual's instructions</i>

<i>to place the plant

48:03.760 --> 48:08.660
<i>and the Axiom will immediately

48:08.760 --> 48:10.430
<i>- It's that easy.
- Huh!</i>

48:10.530 --> 48:13.300
<i>Now, due to the effects of microgravity,</i>

48:13.400 --> 48:15.960
<i>you and your passengers may have suffered some</i>

48:16.410 --> 48:17.500
<i>slight bone loss.</i>

48:18.810 --> 48:22.500
<i>But I'm sure a few laps

48:22.610 --> 48:24.670
<i>will get you back in shape in no time.</i>

48:24.780 --> 48:25.800
We have a jogging track?

48:25.910 --> 48:27.710
<i>If you have any further questions,</i>

48:27.820 --> 48:30.750
<i>just consult your operation manual.</i>

48:30.850 --> 48:32.950
<i>See you back home real soon.</i>

48:36.690 --> 48:38.760
"Operate Manuel."

Uh...

48:41.000 --> 48:44.230
Manuel, relay instructions.

48:45.970 --> 48:47.130
Manuel?

48:54.410 --> 48:57.000
Wow. Will you look at that?

48:58.480 --> 48:59.540
Let's see.

49:01.180 --> 49:02.150
Huh?

49:52.730 --> 49:53.700
Ooh.

49:57.010 --> 49:59.000
- Where's the thingy?
- Plant.

49:59.110 --> 50:01.340
Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?

50:02.740 --> 50:04.010
Maybe we missed a step.

50:04.110 --> 50:05.710
- Show me how you change...
- Plant.

50:06.210 --> 50:08.080

- Plant!

50:15.220 --> 50:16.520
Why don't you scan her to be sure?

50:23.570 --> 50:27.870
Contains no specimen.
Probe's memory is faulty.

50:27.970 --> 50:32.700
- So then, we're not going to Earth?
- Negative.

50:32.810 --> 50:35.070
I guess things go back to normal, huh?

50:35.180 --> 50:36.970
Correct, Captain.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.170
<i>- Well, false alarm!
- False alarm.</i>

50:41.420 --> 50:43.150
The probe must be defective.

50:44.350 --> 50:46.910
GO-4, send her to the repair ward,

50:47.560 --> 50:50.460
and have them run diagnostics on her.
Make sure she's not...

50:50.560 --> 50:51.530
Ah!

50:59.200 --> 51:00.360

You didn't give up, did you?

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.810
Okay, then. Come on.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.210
Wait a minute.

01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:40.610
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.580
WALL-E.

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:52.580
EVE.

01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:54.260
EVE.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.190
EVE.

01:05:58.570 --> 01:05:59.530
Pathetic.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.130
EVE.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:14.000
EVE!

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.150
Oh!

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.170
Huh?

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:35.260
Foreign contaminant.

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.200
There you go, little guy.

01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:48.150
You came a long way for a drink of water.

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:50.950
Just needed someone to look after you, that's...

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:06.160
We have to go back.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.100
<i>- Auto, come down here.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

WALL-E.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:15.340
WALL-E.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.980
<i>Auto, EVE found the plant.
Fire up the holo-detector.</i>

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.810
Not necessary, Captain.
You may give it to me.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.350
- You know what? I should do it myself.
- Captain.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:31.820
Sir, I insist you give me the plant.

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:35.380
- Auto, get out of my way.
- We cannot go home.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:39.260
- What are you talking about? Why not?
- That is classified, Captain.

01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:41.660
- Give me the plant.
- What do you mean, "classified"?

01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:43.240
You don't keep a secret from the captain.

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.430
Give me the plant.

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.870
- Tell me what's classified.
- The plant.

01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:48.810
Tell me, Auto! That's an order.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.110
Aye, aye, sir.

<i>Operation Cleanup has,</i>

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.570
<i>well, failed.</i>

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.240
<i>Wouldn't you know,
rising toxicity levels have made life</i>

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.070
<i>unsustainable on Earth.</i>

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.140
"Unsustainable"? What?

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:28.270
<i>Darn it all, we're going to have
to cancel Operation Recolonize.</i>

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.410
<i>So,</i>

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:31.880
<i>just stay the course.</i>

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:33.080
<i>Um...</i>

01:08:33.190 --> 01:08:35.180
<i>Rather than try and fix this problem,</i>

01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:38.590
<i>it'll just be easier
for everyone to remain in space.</i>

01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:39.850
"Easier"?

- Sir, time to go.</i>

01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:47.220

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.410
<i>Take control of everything,

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:55.700
<i>Repeat, do not return to Earth.</i>

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.340
<i>Let's get the heck out of here.</i>

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.080
Now, the plant.

01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:06.150
No. Wait a minute.

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:08.620
<i>Computer, when was that message
sent out to the Axiom?</i>

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.160
<i>Message received in the year 2110.</i>

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.660
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.790
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.560
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:25.610
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:29.040
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, Captain.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:33.140
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:34.510
Home, Auto.

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:38.350
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:39.750
That's all I've ever done.

01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:43.150
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

<i>On the Axiom you will survive.</i>

01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:50.390
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.010
<i>I'm the captain of the Axiom.</i>

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.750

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.020
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:36.140
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

Please hold.

Halt.

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:14.720
- That's it. A little closer.
- Cease and desist.

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.760
- Not good.
- Got you.

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:43.440
Whoa!

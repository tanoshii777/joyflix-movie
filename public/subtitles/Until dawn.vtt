WEBVTT

00:01:24.052 --> 00:01:26.420
No! No! No!

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:27.889
No!

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.968
Yes.

00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:04.458
No.

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:07.394
No, no.

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.262
Please.

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.032
No, I can't die again.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:13.501
I can't. I can't do it.

00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:16.971
Please, not again.
I can't.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:19.641
No. No, no.

00:02:19.774 --> 00:02:21.408
No. No. No, please!

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:22.510
No!

00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.559
It looks like rain.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.965
Um, hey, so...

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.567
what's the plan
when we get there?

00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:21.969
Like, we gonna do some sort
of ritual or something?

00:03:22.103 --> 00:03:23.270
I'm not prepared
for any rituals.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.405
Not your "woo-woo"
kind of ritual.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.409
More like a... like a closing
ceremony thing, you know?

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:30.878
This is the last stop
of our tour,

00:03:31.012 --> 00:03:32.780
and even though we've learned
absolutely nothing new...

00:03:32.914 --> 00:03:34.182
...we should probably

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.683
mark the occasion.

00:03:35.817 --> 00:03:39.520
Like a, like a celebration
of our failure kind of thing?

00:03:39.654 --> 00:03:42.190
-Yeah. Sure. Whatever.
-Right.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.159
I-I'm not really sure
what we were expecting anyways.

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:46.359
Closure.

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:47.595
Isn't that usually
what people are after

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:48.863
in these kinds of situations?

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:50.598
We're not
getting closure.

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:53.701
She's missing. Not dead.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:56.637
No. Yeah, of course.
I was just asking.

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.715
Wait, wait, wait. Clover,
please don't delete. Just...

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:10.283
Just watch.

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:14.088
Look, I know
I could've handled

00:04:14.222 --> 00:04:16.858
our goodbye differently.

00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:20.128
I could've handled everything
after Mom's death differently.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.898
I just couldn't stay
in that house any longer.

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:26.934
But it's not too late
for you to join me.

00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:29.402
And I know it's not
an easy decision

00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:31.706
but, please, call me back.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:32.807
I miss you.

00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:47.622
Kinda eerie being here
a year later.

00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:48.956
Max!

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.091
What?

00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:51.324
He's right though.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.426
It is. It's eerie and it's...

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.896
it's kind of sad.

00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:56.864
Sorry, Clover.

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:02.503
I think we should join hands.

00:05:02.637 --> 00:05:03.838
-No.
-Jesus Christ, Megan.

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.606
We've done it literally
everywhere else.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.009
It'd feel kind of incomplete
if we didn't do it here.

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:10.111
Clover knows I've got
special shit going on, so--

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:11.512
Special shit going on?

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:13.915
Your biggest psychic achievement
was when you "sensed"

00:05:14.048 --> 00:05:15.650
that your dad was having
an affair with Max's mom

00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:16.717
before anybody else.

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:17.852
I was right.

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.352
Remember that one,
Clover?

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:20.721
I mean, we all sensed it when
we heard them in the garage.

00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:22.256
Gross. And that's still my mom.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.992
But, actually,
can we, can we try, please?

00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:26.160
She probably disappeared

00:05:26.294 --> 00:05:27.962
not long after that video
was recorded

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:29.597
and that's a pretty big deal.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.998
And we all feel it.

00:05:31.132 --> 00:05:33.701
So maybe we'll tap into
some of her residual energy.

00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:36.204
Yeah, it's fine. Let's-let's...
Let's do the hand thing.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.706
Okay, okay, great. Great. Okay.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.141
-Okay.
-All right.

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:41.309
It's fine.

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:43.911
All right, now, everyone...

00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:45.046
Close your eyes.

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:50.685
And try to tune everything out.

00:05:52.053 --> 00:05:55.223
You have to think of it
like an old radio or TV.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.159
So sometimes you catch a signal,

00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:01.361
but most of the time
it's just static.

00:06:02.864 --> 00:06:04.031
Keep trying.

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:05.867
Slow your breathing down.

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:07.668
In.

00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:10.771
And out.

00:06:12.874 --> 00:06:13.875
In.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:16.476
And out.

00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:20.380
In.

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:22.283
And out.

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.450
-Oh, my God!
-Hey!

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:24.585
-Watch out!
-Get out of the road!

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.722
Slow down!
Jesus Christ.

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:28.856
What the hell?

00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:32.326
Okay, um...

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.095
Let's-let's try again,
okay? So...

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.830
Clover?

00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:39.567
-Clover! Hey!
-Max-- Hey, Max.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.136
Just stop. Just give her
some space for a second, okay?

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.872
Don't forget why she dumped you
in the first place.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:47.341
She didn't dump me.
I broke up with her.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.077
Because she wanted space,
which you wouldn't give her.

00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:51.846
Since when have you
been the expert on space?

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.615
Excuse me?
What is that supposed to mean?

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:55.917
Ever since kindergarten,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.551
you've always needed
to be in a relationship.

00:06:57.685 --> 00:06:59.287
-She does? Do you?
-No, I do not.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.789
Six months ago,
there was a guy just like you.

00:07:01.923 --> 00:07:04.025
And three months before that,
there was a girl just like you.

00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:05.927
-Julia.
-Julia?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.128
How long have you guys
been together for?

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.429
-Three months.
-Hmm.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:11.399
Hopefully she waits to break up
with you till we get back.

00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:13.000
-Max.
-Well, uh, if she doesn't,

00:07:13.134 --> 00:07:15.236
do you guys
still have Julia's number?

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:16.904
Fuck off.

00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:35.488
Hey.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:37.457
Hey.

00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:38.592
Just that.

00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:40.962
Two dollars.

00:07:42.063 --> 00:07:43.264
Thank you.

00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:46.434
Excuse me, I saw you
and your friends out there.

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:47.535
What was that?

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:51.238
Like a prayer circle?

00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:53.574
Uh, yeah, something like that.

00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:55.509
Huh.

00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:57.945
-'Kay. Thank you.
-Yeah. You bet.

00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:02.783
Um...

00:08:02.917 --> 00:08:04.986
Sorry, were-were you
working here last year?

00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:07.555
Last year
and the year before that

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:10.324
and the year before that
and the year before that,

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:12.159
and on and on and on.

00:08:12.293 --> 00:08:14.295
You know,
each year is the same...

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:16.731
but different.

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:20.234
Totally.

00:08:20.368 --> 00:08:21.936
Uh, well, then,
can I ask you something?

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:23.070
Um...

00:08:24.372 --> 00:08:26.273
Does she look
familiar to you at all?

00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:27.975
Pretty.

00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:31.979
She looks a lot like you.

00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:36.050
She's gone missing, huh?

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:39.320
I didn't say that.

00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:42.556
Well, you're not
the first one who come here

00:08:43.824 --> 00:08:47.128
asking me if I seen someone.

00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:49.463
I mean, do a lot of people
go missing around here?

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:51.265
Here? No.

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:54.735
-But up the ways a bit...
-...in Glore Valley.

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:56.303
That's where
people get in trouble.

00:08:57.371 --> 00:08:58.372
Glore Valley?

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:00.274
Yeah.

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:06.747
Stop.

00:09:06.881 --> 00:09:08.416
-Oh, you're so grumpy today.
-Hey, um, yo.

00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:10.985
Can I say something real quick
before Clover

00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:12.386
-comes back out here?
-Yeah.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:13.454
You guys told me this trip

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:15.389
was like
a get-out-of-town kind of thing.

00:09:15.524 --> 00:09:16.857
You know, I didn't realize
we were gonna be

00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:19.760
retracing her sister's
final journey.

00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:21.128
So I just have to say,

00:09:21.262 --> 00:09:23.297
-as a psych major...
-As a psych major...

00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:26.000
Yes. Thank you.

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:28.936
As a psych major, um,
I don't know

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.971
if this is the best thing
for Clover.

00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:32.440
I think the intentions
were great.

00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:35.242
Exactly. And this could be
what she needs to move on.

00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:37.478
Or this could trigger her to...

00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:40.314
you know, again.

00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:43.250
Then why did you come if
you thought it was a bad idea?

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:44.952
Just to spend more time
with Clover?

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:47.621
Because the way we get through
fucked-up shit

00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:49.890
is by sticking together.
You know?

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:51.025
So let's not blame each other

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:52.626
for where we're at
right now, okay?

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.994
I mean, if we're gonna
blame anybody,

00:09:54.128 --> 00:09:55.930
then it should be Melanie.

00:09:56.063 --> 00:09:57.898
Their mom had just died,
like, weeks before.

00:09:58.032 --> 00:09:59.300
She shouldn't have left Clover
when she did.

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:00.768
That was
the selfish choice here.

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:02.069
Guys.

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:06.740
I think I know
where Mel went missing.

00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:22.089
-Hey. It's okay.
-This is crazy.

00:10:22.223 --> 00:10:24.024
The car is the safest place
to be during a storm, okay?

00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:25.426
Don't say shit like that, Max.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.927
It's true.
Everyone knows that it's--

00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:28.896
Max! Don't say shit like that.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:30.030
Can we just turn around?

00:10:30.164 --> 00:10:31.533
I don't understand
what I did wrong.

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:32.800
Because you're gonna
jinx us, okay?

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:34.135
Somebody says
something like that,

00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:35.970
and then, wham,
Abe runs into something,

00:10:36.103 --> 00:10:37.238
then we're all
fucking dead, okay?

00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:38.639
So don't say shit like that.

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:40.141
Abe, can we just
turn around, please?

00:10:40.274 --> 00:10:42.009
Not again. I've turned around
two times already.

00:10:42.143 --> 00:10:43.310
So turn around again.

00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:44.411
We're just gonna
keep turning around.

00:10:44.546 --> 00:10:45.646
We're never gonna get anywhere.

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:46.780
Just stop the car.

00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:48.182
We can't see out of the window.

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:49.950
I can't even fucking
hear myself think.

00:10:55.256 --> 00:10:56.223
What the hell?

00:10:56.824 --> 00:10:58.359
Holy shit.

00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:00.928
What is going on?

00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:04.031
-I think I'm gonna be sick.
-Abe.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:05.866
Yeah.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:13.307
Megan?

00:11:27.622 --> 00:11:29.658
Are you guys seeing this?

00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:32.059
It's all around us.

00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:41.335
There's a name for this
kind of weather anomaly.

00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:42.403
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:11:42.537 --> 00:11:43.538
What is it?

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.473
I don't know. I don't remember.

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:49.511
It's cool, though.

00:11:49.644 --> 00:11:52.079
Cool, weird, whatever it is,
we should probably just

00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:53.747
get back in the car
and keep going home.

00:11:53.881 --> 00:11:55.316
No way, dude.
I'm not driving through that

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:57.251
fucking storm again.
We gotta wait it out.

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:59.453
Or we could
just find another way.

00:12:00.087 --> 00:12:01.088
Fuck.

00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:03.357
Is anyone getting a signal?

00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:05.092
I am.

00:12:09.063 --> 00:12:10.030
A bad one.

00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:11.365
Great.

00:12:11.498 --> 00:12:12.967
Oh, you know what? Waterwall.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.536
What?

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:17.238
I think it's called, like,
yeah, a waterwall.

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:19.608
That sounds made-up as hell.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.976
No, that's-that's what
the song is from.

00:12:22.109 --> 00:12:23.545
What?

00:12:23.678 --> 00:12:25.913
Maybe there's someone inside
that could tell us where we are.

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:28.215
-We can start making a plan.
-Yeah.

00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:29.750
-All right.
-Good idea.

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:33.020
It's crazy.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:48.969
Hello?

00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:53.007
Hello?

00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:59.246
Hello? Anyone here?

00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:01.750
Damn.

00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:04.552
Huh.

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:45.993
Feels like we're
the first people here in years.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.462
Yeah. Where is everyone?

00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:06.880
Fun.

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:48.723
Clover?

00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:55.896
Mel?

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:12.614
Clover!

00:15:13.882 --> 00:15:15.683
Clover!

00:15:40.909 --> 00:15:42.744
Clover!

00:15:42.877 --> 00:15:44.344
Clover!

00:15:44.478 --> 00:15:46.413
Clover!

00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:49.283
Max?

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:22.983
Holy shit.

00:16:24.819 --> 00:16:25.820
Clover.

00:16:26.654 --> 00:16:27.655
Are you okay?

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:30.525
I thought I saw someone.

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:36.129
O-Okay, let's go inside. Okay?

00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:02.222
Oh, shit.

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:04.191
"Oh, shit" what?

00:17:05.927 --> 00:17:06.995
Look.

00:17:08.696 --> 00:17:09.831
Oh, shit!

00:17:10.565 --> 00:17:11.566
Guys.

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:14.234
You should see this.

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:17.471
There's no details on hers
or any of the others.

00:17:17.605 --> 00:17:19.406
Like no date of birth,

00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:20.909
no height and weight,
no last seen location,

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.477
not even a phone number to
contact if you have information.

00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:24.946
So, what's the point, then?

00:17:27.414 --> 00:17:28.683
I found something too.

00:17:39.293 --> 00:17:40.962
"Glore Valley."
This-this is it.

00:17:41.996 --> 00:17:43.297
This is where Mel went missing.

00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:45.934
That was her
I heard in the rain.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:47.669
Wait, what? Look, I-I...

00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:49.102
I'm so confused right now.

00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:51.171
I heard someone call my name,
and it sounded like Mel.

00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:53.206
But I-I didn't wanna
let myself believe that.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.043
And then I come in here
and I see this.

00:17:55.175 --> 00:17:57.545
Yeah, but, Clover,
it's weird, right?

00:17:57.679 --> 00:18:00.247
I'm telling you it's her. Look.

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:03.116
Holy shit.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.686
Yeah, I know.

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:07.454
Wait, did-did one of you guys
turn this over?

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:09.489
Max?

00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:12.225
No. What does that
have to do with anything?

00:18:12.359 --> 00:18:13.962
Because it wasn't
turned over before.

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.095
Wait.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.065
Do you guys hear that?

00:18:17.197 --> 00:18:18.165
Yeah.

00:18:27.307 --> 00:18:28.308
Where's my car?

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:30.110
Shit.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.921
Is that my fucking car?

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:45.860
Back inside.

00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:47.494
Back inside. Go.

00:18:56.704 --> 00:18:58.039
Is he just gonna sit there?

00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:00.173
Better question,
are we just gonna sit here?

00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:01.308
Well, what else can we do?

00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:02.877
Can we do a phone check again?

00:19:03.011 --> 00:19:04.612
Nothing's been working
since we got here, though.

00:19:04.746 --> 00:19:06.413
There has to be a phone
around here somewhere.

00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:08.616
You wanna look for one,
go ahead.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.150
Not taking my eyes off this guy.

00:19:26.134 --> 00:19:27.535
Shit.

00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:40.273
Why are there
windows underground?

00:20:44.344 --> 00:20:45.345
You guys, there's a phone.

00:20:50.218 --> 00:20:51.552
There's a dial tone.

00:20:51.686 --> 00:20:53.755
It's okay. It's just somebody
fucking with us probably.

00:20:53.888 --> 00:20:55.790
-It's... it's gonna be fine.
-Yeah.

00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:03.263
It's-it's not working.

00:21:05.298 --> 00:21:06.299
Unless...

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.401
Unless what?

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.806
Unless this is what happened to
Melanie

00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:13.975
before she went missing.

00:21:18.045 --> 00:21:19.346
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

00:21:20.948 --> 00:21:22.083
Hello?

00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:27.320
Guys?

00:21:28.589 --> 00:21:29.657
I'm gonna just--

00:21:29.791 --> 00:21:31.726
I'll check it out,
and I'll be right back.

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:32.827
Okay?

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.327
Okay.

00:21:41.068 --> 00:21:42.003
Hello?

00:22:00.822 --> 00:22:01.923
Is anyone there?

00:22:10.932 --> 00:22:11.999
Abe?

00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:27.014
Abe?

00:22:43.998 --> 00:22:44.999
Abe?

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.608
Abe?

00:23:12.425 --> 00:23:14.195
Is that Nina?

00:23:14.328 --> 00:23:15.363
What the fuck?

00:23:20.635 --> 00:23:21.836
I'm gonna go
check it out, okay?

00:23:21.969 --> 00:23:22.937
Okay.

00:23:41.389 --> 00:23:43.057
Go, go, go, go! Hide!
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.905
Please.

00:27:00.522 --> 00:27:01.755
Mel--

00:27:49.803 --> 00:27:51.739
Ah. Holy shit.

00:27:53.508 --> 00:27:54.708
How am I still alive right now?

00:27:55.577 --> 00:27:56.545
You were killed.

00:27:57.778 --> 00:27:58.779
I saw it. I...

00:28:00.481 --> 00:28:01.550
Well, I died.

00:28:02.183 --> 00:28:03.150
He got you too?

00:28:03.284 --> 00:28:04.251
Yeah.

00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:07.755
Wait. What about the others?

00:28:09.456 --> 00:28:10.691
Let's go.

00:28:14.428 --> 00:28:15.462
Are you guys okay?

00:28:15.597 --> 00:28:16.797
-What just happened?
-We don't know.

00:28:17.998 --> 00:28:19.033
Megan. Hey.

00:28:20.034 --> 00:28:21.402
Wait, where's Abe?

00:28:21.536 --> 00:28:23.337
-Abe?
-I'm back here.

00:28:24.573 --> 00:28:27.241
I'm pretty sure
we're fucked, guys.

00:28:43.525 --> 00:28:45.259
Holy shit.

00:28:45.392 --> 00:28:47.027
It has ahold of us now.

00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:49.330
What... what do you mean, "it"?

00:28:49.463 --> 00:28:51.198
I'm not sure.

00:28:51.332 --> 00:28:54.034
I just know that I can feel it,
stronger than before--

00:28:54.168 --> 00:28:55.102
We need to get
the fuck out of here

00:28:55.236 --> 00:28:56.203
while we still have the chance.

00:28:56.337 --> 00:28:58.105
No! No!
He could still be out there.

00:28:58.239 --> 00:29:00.174
We didn't see anyone out there.
And the Jeep is back now.

00:29:00.307 --> 00:29:02.209
Perfect. Let's take it.
We need to go. Right now.

00:29:02.343 --> 00:29:03.511
I don't think we can.

00:29:03.645 --> 00:29:05.212
You don't know that.
None of us know anything.

00:29:05.346 --> 00:29:08.449
Well, I know that
you were fucking murdered

00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:09.551
about ten minutes ago.

00:29:09.684 --> 00:29:11.952
And I know that
because I saw it!

00:29:12.086 --> 00:29:15.289
I saw it right before
I was fucking murdered!

00:29:15.422 --> 00:29:16.857
And now I'm here again,

00:29:16.991 --> 00:29:19.360
and my name is in that fucking
book again just like Mel's,

00:29:19.493 --> 00:29:21.095
but who knows
what the fuck happened to her.

00:29:21.228 --> 00:29:23.565
So the night
is just starting over again?

00:29:23.698 --> 00:29:24.999
Like in whatever the fuck
that movie's called?

00:29:25.132 --> 00:29:26.467
Like, that shit's actually real?

00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:28.737
There's been a bunch of movies
about that, but like--

00:29:32.273 --> 00:29:34.041
I don't remember
that happening last time.

00:29:34.174 --> 00:29:36.645
So it's not like those movies.

00:29:37.278 --> 00:29:38.345
Good to know.

00:29:41.782 --> 00:29:43.150
That didn't either.

00:29:43.284 --> 00:29:44.753
Oh, fuck!

00:30:16.618 --> 00:30:18.687
Abe?

00:30:18.819 --> 00:30:19.820
Oh, shit!

00:30:21.288 --> 00:30:22.489
Uh, fuck.

00:30:44.612 --> 00:30:47.948
Hey. Hey. Megan. Hey. You okay?

00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:50.552
Tonight feels different.

00:30:50.685 --> 00:30:51.686
What do you mean?

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:52.853
Worse.

00:30:52.986 --> 00:30:54.756
Fuck.

00:30:54.888 --> 00:30:57.525
Okay, okay. Well, um...

00:30:57.659 --> 00:30:59.326
Just so you know...

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.696
you know the whole psychic thing

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.666
and you getting a signal
or whatever?

00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:05.899
Totally believe you now.

00:31:09.537 --> 00:31:10.705
-Meg. Megan! Megan!
-Meg!

00:31:10.839 --> 00:31:12.373
Megan!

00:31:12.507 --> 00:31:13.440
Hey, Meg. Hey.

00:31:13.575 --> 00:31:14.709
Megan!

00:31:20.782 --> 00:31:22.082
What the fuck
is happening?!

00:31:22.216 --> 00:31:23.183
Megan?

00:31:23.317 --> 00:31:24.686
-Whoa.
-Megan?

00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:26.721
-Megan?
-Where did Megan go?

00:31:26.855 --> 00:31:27.988
Megan?

00:31:28.122 --> 00:31:30.391
What the fuck?! Where is she?

00:31:30.525 --> 00:31:31.959
Where the fuck did she go?

00:31:32.092 --> 00:31:33.661
Shh.

00:31:34.696 --> 00:31:35.864
Listen.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.108
Meg?

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:23.611
Is someone there?

00:32:23.745 --> 00:32:24.813
Hello?

00:32:24.945 --> 00:32:27.582
Help! Please! Help me! Help!

00:32:27.715 --> 00:32:29.082
Who's there?

00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:32.654
This town was right to be
damned. We're all sinners here.

00:32:34.589 --> 00:32:35.824
Make it stop.

00:32:35.956 --> 00:32:38.726
I just wanna die.
Please. Please just let me die.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.093
Where's my mom?

00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:41.763
Mommy?

00:32:41.896 --> 00:32:43.330
And then
all of a sudden

00:32:43.464 --> 00:32:45.098
...she started to
attack me, but it wasn't her.

00:32:45.232 --> 00:32:46.768
Nobody is coming for us.

00:32:46.901 --> 00:32:49.336
They're just gonna watch us die
over and over again.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.171
Has anyone seen Tommy?

00:32:51.305 --> 00:32:53.273
My hair. My bones. Please.

00:32:53.407 --> 00:32:54.975
It's what it's doing to us.

00:32:55.108 --> 00:32:56.176
Can it just be over?

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.512
What we're becoming.

00:32:57.645 --> 00:32:59.346
I can't remember my own name.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.648
Please just kill me.

00:33:00.782 --> 00:33:02.617
I just want it to end.

00:33:07.755 --> 00:33:08.823
Don't let it in!

00:33:12.459 --> 00:33:13.862
Wait! I wouldn't touch her.

00:33:13.994 --> 00:33:14.963
-Don't touch her!
-Why?!

00:33:15.095 --> 00:33:16.063
Because whatever just

00:33:16.196 --> 00:33:17.565
possessed her
might possess you next.

00:33:17.699 --> 00:33:19.199
That's not how possession works.

00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:20.568
People can't get possessed
by contact.

00:33:20.702 --> 00:33:22.837
You have to be, like,
weak of faith or something.

00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:24.304
Oh, I have faith.
I have a lot of faith.

00:33:24.438 --> 00:33:25.472
Do you think it's still here,

00:33:25.607 --> 00:33:27.307
whatever g-got her,
whatever did this?

00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:28.475
I don't know.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.512
She said something was coming.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.487
Come on.

00:33:54.869 --> 00:33:56.571
I don't see
anyone out there.

00:34:01.174 --> 00:34:02.376
Is anyone in there?

00:34:03.745 --> 00:34:04.712
Melanie?

00:34:04.846 --> 00:34:06.848
Clover!
Oh, my God, is that you?

00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:08.181
Let me in.

00:34:08.315 --> 00:34:09.751
-Please. Clover.
-Mel.

00:34:09.884 --> 00:34:12.152
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

00:34:12.286 --> 00:34:13.420
M-Megan just said
don't let it in.

00:34:13.555 --> 00:34:14.989
Please help me!

00:34:15.155 --> 00:34:16.323
-He's gonna kill me!
-Melanie.

00:34:16.456 --> 00:34:18.258
No, wait.

00:34:18.392 --> 00:34:19.393
Something's hurting her!

00:34:19.527 --> 00:34:20.460
We have to help her.

00:34:20.595 --> 00:34:21.596
We can't just stand here.

00:34:21.729 --> 00:34:23.598
Mel!

00:34:23.731 --> 00:34:24.899
Mel.

00:34:25.033 --> 00:34:26.034
Max.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.268
Help!

00:34:34.474 --> 00:34:35.710
Melanie.

00:34:40.347 --> 00:34:41.348
What's that?

00:34:46.186 --> 00:34:47.622
That house wasn't there before.

00:34:51.191 --> 00:34:53.093
Clover!

00:34:54.896 --> 00:34:57.065
Clover!

00:34:57.197 --> 00:34:58.165
Help!

00:34:59.266 --> 00:35:00.300
Help!

00:35:06.908 --> 00:35:08.408
Guys, please, help!

00:35:08.543 --> 00:35:10.645
Max. Are you okay?

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.117
Clover!

00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:21.689
No! No! No, no, no.

00:35:21.823 --> 00:35:24.659
No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

00:35:24.792 --> 00:35:26.293
No, no, no!

00:35:26.426 --> 00:35:28.462
No. No!

00:35:43.745 --> 00:35:46.080
Fuck! Fuck!

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.022
Clover!

00:35:54.154 --> 00:35:56.024
Wait a minute! Wait.
Just-just hold on, hold on.

00:35:56.156 --> 00:35:57.190
What are you doing?

00:35:57.324 --> 00:35:58.793
-We need to go help Clover.
-Help her?

00:35:58.926 --> 00:36:00.862
Max, she's gone. She just flew
30 feet in the air.

00:36:00.995 --> 00:36:03.463
So we go and get her.
She can't be dead yet.

00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:04.999
"Yet." You just said it.

00:36:05.133 --> 00:36:06.134
And she might be.
You don't even know.

00:36:06.266 --> 00:36:08.301
I think our best move right now

00:36:08.435 --> 00:36:11.105
is leaving to go get help
like we originally said we'd do.

00:36:11.238 --> 00:36:12.774
Megan said
it won't let us leave.

00:36:12.907 --> 00:36:14.374
Megan just said
a lot of things, Max.

00:36:15.743 --> 00:36:16.778
Nina.

00:36:16.911 --> 00:36:18.646
Come on,
you can't be on board with this.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.180
I mean,
we're clearly dealing with

00:36:20.313 --> 00:36:21.716
some really
fucked-up shit here, Max.

00:36:21.849 --> 00:36:24.652
Shit that we're not,
like, equipped for.

00:36:24.786 --> 00:36:26.654
But the only way we get through
fucked-up shit

00:36:26.788 --> 00:36:28.589
is by sticking together.

00:36:29.222 --> 00:36:30.525
You said that.

00:36:31.491 --> 00:36:32.827
You said that.

00:36:34.327 --> 00:36:35.530
Oh, yeah. Okay.
You think this

00:36:35.663 --> 00:36:37.065
is what's gonna get her
to take you back or what?

00:36:37.197 --> 00:36:38.331
Abe!

00:36:42.704 --> 00:36:44.906
If you guys
do make it out of here,

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:46.908
you can both go
and fuck yourselves.

00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:48.910
Wait, M-- Max! Wait!

00:36:50.712 --> 00:36:52.013
What the fuck?

00:36:52.146 --> 00:36:53.447
We're not leaving, Nina.
We're just going to get help.

00:36:53.581 --> 00:36:54.682
Why would you say that to him?

00:36:54.816 --> 00:36:55.850
Because he's going to get
himself killed

00:36:55.983 --> 00:36:56.918
right fuckin' now.

00:36:57.051 --> 00:36:58.152
And, honestly,
I don't know.

00:36:58.285 --> 00:36:59.386
It-it sounded like something
you would say.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.022
Yeah, but when I say
those things to them,

00:37:01.155 --> 00:37:02.557
they know that I don't mean it.

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.257
Clover, Max, Megan,
they're, like...

00:37:04.391 --> 00:37:05.793
they're like
the only consistent people

00:37:05.927 --> 00:37:07.061
that I've had in my life ever.

00:37:07.195 --> 00:37:09.429
I know. And you wanna
save them. Right?

00:37:09.564 --> 00:37:12.232
We can't save them
unless we save ourselves first.

00:37:12.365 --> 00:37:15.570
So-so, you think that
we could just drive

00:37:15.703 --> 00:37:16.671
out of here?
That it's that easy.

00:37:16.804 --> 00:37:17.805
I don't know.
But, you know what,

00:37:17.939 --> 00:37:20.942
we won't know
if we don't try. Okay?

00:37:21.075 --> 00:37:23.376
What I do know is that
if we just keep sitting here,

00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:25.412
something else very bad
is gonna happen to us.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:31.284
-So we try and get help.
-Yeah.

00:38:21.736 --> 00:38:23.070
Hello?

00:38:39.954 --> 00:38:41.222
Hello?

00:39:00.808 --> 00:39:02.877
...from the
mine collapse that tragically

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.147
struck the town
just two days ago.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.649
There are still no confirmed
number of casualties

00:39:08.783 --> 00:39:10.918
but officials
are fearing the worst.

00:39:49.357 --> 00:39:50.390
No.

00:39:51.525 --> 00:39:52.492
Please let me out.

00:39:52.627 --> 00:39:53.861
Please.

00:39:54.394 --> 00:39:55.563
I want out.

00:39:55.696 --> 00:39:57.365
Only one way out.

00:39:57.497 --> 00:39:59.600
You either survive the night

00:39:59.734 --> 00:40:02.103
or become
a part of it.

00:40:06.173 --> 00:40:08.075
Please let me out.

00:40:08.209 --> 00:40:09.277
Please let me out.

00:40:11.779 --> 00:40:13.247
No.

00:40:13.381 --> 00:40:16.117
No. No. No. No!

00:40:16.684 --> 00:40:18.185
No! No!

00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:20.021
Suffer.

00:40:20.154 --> 00:40:23.057
Suffer like the rest
of this cursed town.

00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:26.894
Suffer until hell
opens up...

00:40:27.028 --> 00:40:29.297
...and
swallows you too.

00:40:56.857 --> 00:40:58.259
Fuck.

00:41:02.663 --> 00:41:03.931
Clover?

00:41:15.977 --> 00:41:18.145
Wait, I can't do this.
I can't leave my friends.

00:41:18.279 --> 00:41:20.480
-Nina, baby. We have to go.
-No.

00:41:20.614 --> 00:41:22.116
-I don't wanna leave my friends.
-No. Nina, no.

00:41:22.249 --> 00:41:24.618
What are you doing?
Unlock the door!

00:41:26.754 --> 00:41:27.955
We have to go.
We're going to get help.

00:41:28.089 --> 00:41:29.156
Abe, unlock the-- No, Abe!

00:41:33.227 --> 00:41:34.695
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:40.401
What is that? What is that?

00:41:40.534 --> 00:41:42.470
-What is that?
-I have no idea!

00:41:42.603 --> 00:41:43.637
Oh, my God.

00:41:43.771 --> 00:41:44.805
Go!

00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:45.906
Go!

00:41:54.515 --> 00:41:56.050
My door's still locked.

00:41:56.183 --> 00:41:57.385
My door is locked!

00:42:03.924 --> 00:42:05.092
Abe?

00:42:12.533 --> 00:42:13.868
Clover.

00:42:55.176 --> 00:42:56.410
Clover?

00:44:55.896 --> 00:44:57.031
Fucking clowns.

00:44:58.966 --> 00:45:00.467
Whoa! Fuck!

00:45:00.602 --> 00:45:01.570
Clover?

00:46:05.899 --> 00:46:07.434
I guess we died again.

00:46:07.569 --> 00:46:08.603
Yeah.

00:46:10.204 --> 00:46:12.373
Is this just
gonna keep happening?

00:46:13.407 --> 00:46:14.408
I don't know.

00:46:53.414 --> 00:46:56.685
"Survive the night,
or become a part of it."

00:47:03.023 --> 00:47:04.024
There's no water--

00:47:06.327 --> 00:47:07.328
What?

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:16.738
Anyone else?

00:47:17.605 --> 00:47:18.640
Please.

00:47:22.042 --> 00:47:23.745
Okay.

00:47:23.877 --> 00:47:26.715
So you're sure
that's what she said

00:47:26.847 --> 00:47:29.517
about surviving?

00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:32.486
And it was like
a for-real witch?

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.489
I-I think it was
a for-real witch.

00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:38.058
I mean...

00:47:39.126 --> 00:47:41.830
Yeah, I think
that's what she said.

00:47:41.962 --> 00:47:43.864
That's like the only thing
I can remember.

00:47:45.533 --> 00:47:47.334
Well...

00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:50.170
The good news is that I think
this means there's a way out.

00:47:52.373 --> 00:47:53.508
What's that?

00:47:56.176 --> 00:47:57.712
"Survive the night."

00:47:57.846 --> 00:48:00.548
Right? So, maybe
if we can make it until dawn,

00:48:00.682 --> 00:48:02.416
then maybe this will be over.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:04.652
Okay, but what about the rest?

00:48:04.786 --> 00:48:07.020
"Or become a part of it."

00:48:07.154 --> 00:48:09.156
Yeah, part of the night, right?

00:48:09.289 --> 00:48:10.924
It means that
if we don't get out,

00:48:11.058 --> 00:48:12.359
we're stuck here forever.

00:48:12.493 --> 00:48:17.599
And shit like this and that
will just keep happening.

00:48:17.732 --> 00:48:19.701
We're turning
into something else.

00:48:20.568 --> 00:48:22.302
You guys get that, right?

00:48:22.436 --> 00:48:25.072
Okay, so we'll just
stick it out in here

00:48:25.205 --> 00:48:26.541
until the sun comes up,
like Max said.

00:48:27.742 --> 00:48:29.544
But what about Mel?

00:48:29.677 --> 00:48:31.546
She's still stuck here
too somewhere.

00:48:31.679 --> 00:48:33.648
If Mel was still stuck,
then she would be here.

00:48:33.782 --> 00:48:35.249
And all those people
on that wall,

00:48:35.382 --> 00:48:37.719
they would be here,
and they're not, so...

00:48:38.686 --> 00:48:39.621
Where are they?

00:48:39.754 --> 00:48:41.088
Oh, my God.

00:48:41.221 --> 00:48:43.924
We didn't come here
looking for Mel, okay, Clover?

00:48:44.057 --> 00:48:46.293
We came hoping
to find you again.

00:48:47.027 --> 00:48:48.262
Like, the old you.

00:48:48.395 --> 00:48:49.831
We were hoping this
would help you move on.

00:48:51.165 --> 00:48:53.133
Help you get back to,
you know, living.

00:48:56.871 --> 00:48:59.440
Abe?

00:48:59.574 --> 00:49:01.308
-Are you okay?
-Here, take some.

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.077
Abe.

00:49:08.182 --> 00:49:09.383
Holy fuck!

00:49:13.353 --> 00:49:15.155
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:49:15.289 --> 00:49:17.725
It's in my mouth!
It's in my mouth!

00:49:19.026 --> 00:49:21.596
Nina! Stop! The water.

00:49:21.729 --> 00:49:23.665
-You saw him drink the water.
-Didn't we all drink the wat--?

00:49:26.901 --> 00:49:29.002
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:49:38.445 --> 00:49:39.747
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:41.683
I-I need a second to think.
That was a lot.

00:49:44.886 --> 00:49:45.854
Meg?

00:49:46.453 --> 00:49:47.454
No.

00:49:48.222 --> 00:49:49.156
Meg?

00:49:49.289 --> 00:49:51.158
-Megan?
-No, no, no. Please.

00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:52.993
Please. No.

00:49:55.028 --> 00:49:56.831
Megan.

00:50:02.469 --> 00:50:04.037
-What do we do, Max?
-I don't know.

00:50:16.951 --> 00:50:18.953
Oh, my God.

00:50:21.756 --> 00:50:23.858
I don't know what to do.

00:50:23.992 --> 00:50:24.926
Help me.

00:50:25.058 --> 00:50:26.995
Megan.
What do we do?

00:50:27.127 --> 00:50:28.596
Megan.

00:50:35.135 --> 00:50:36.103
Kill me, Max.

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:39.007
What? No!

00:50:39.139 --> 00:50:41.074
Please.
All of our friends are dead.

00:50:41.208 --> 00:50:42.476
And w-- and
we drank the water,

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:44.144
and we're covered
in the same shit they were.

00:50:44.278 --> 00:50:47.414
No, we need to start over
and come up with a plan.

00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:49.651
Look-look-look. The sand
has almost run out.

00:50:49.784 --> 00:50:52.754
It's almost dawn.
Okay? And maybe we'll survive.

00:50:52.887 --> 00:50:56.423
We'll come back. Okay? Okay?
It's only been twice so far.

00:50:56.558 --> 00:50:58.292
And you saw the other signatures
in the book.

00:50:58.425 --> 00:50:59.794
Everyone else has way more.

00:51:00.695 --> 00:51:02.195
We'll come back.

00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:04.064
We need to try and save them.

00:51:11.005 --> 00:51:12.072
Please...

00:51:12.205 --> 00:51:15.108
Please do it. Please hurry.
Max, hurry.

00:51:19.047 --> 00:51:20.213
I can't! I can't.

00:51:20.347 --> 00:51:21.281
Max, no.

00:51:21.415 --> 00:51:22.951
I can't. I'm sorry.

00:51:58.586 --> 00:51:59.754
You?

00:52:02.155 --> 00:52:04.458
You almost made it.

00:52:04.592 --> 00:52:06.126
Almost!

00:52:06.259 --> 00:52:08.428
But not quite.

00:52:08.563 --> 00:52:13.901
You don't survive
by sitting still, Miss Clover.

00:52:18.271 --> 00:52:19.406
What?

00:52:56.844 --> 00:52:58.980
Is anyone else
growing new teeth?

00:52:59.113 --> 00:53:00.715
Wait, how many
are we supposed to have?

00:53:00.848 --> 00:53:02.215
I don't know,
but it's an even number.

00:53:04.484 --> 00:53:07.922
Guys, clearly it doesn't work
to just wait it out.

00:53:08.056 --> 00:53:09.222
I mean, there has to be

00:53:09.356 --> 00:53:10.825
something here
to help us come up with a plan.

00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:22.837
Holy fuck. This is the guy.

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:26.339
This is... Yeah, this is the guy
from the gas station. Look!

00:53:26.473 --> 00:53:28.710
-What?
-He's Dr. Alan Hill.

00:53:28.843 --> 00:53:31.112
He's-he's, like, somehow
connected to this place.

00:53:31.244 --> 00:53:33.047
Why? What's so
special about it?

00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:35.415
Twenty years ago
there was a mining disaster.

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:37.250
Happened right here
in Glore Valley.

00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:41.421
"Working with outside engineers,

00:53:41.556 --> 00:53:42.757
"investigators confirmed
the destruction

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:44.458
"was caused by boring
too deep into the earth

00:53:44.592 --> 00:53:45.927
"and too far under the town,

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:48.162
"resulting in the death
of over 1,100 people.

00:53:48.295 --> 00:53:50.330
"Dr. Alan Hill,
a trauma specialist,

00:53:50.464 --> 00:53:53.735
"was brought in
to work with the survivors."

00:53:53.868 --> 00:53:56.537
The whole town got, like,
swallowed up by the earth.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.743
That's why there's
no other houses here.

00:54:01.876 --> 00:54:03.978
And that's why
there's windows down here.

00:54:04.112 --> 00:54:05.780
This whole floor
used to be above ground.

00:54:07.548 --> 00:54:08.816
That means
that's the front door.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:10.383
Guys, who gives a shit?

00:54:10.518 --> 00:54:11.519
I feel like
we really need

00:54:11.652 --> 00:54:12.587
to just be getting
weapons right now.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.254
Okay, but I think we need more

00:54:14.387 --> 00:54:15.590
than just weapons
of brute force.

00:54:15.723 --> 00:54:18.025
Like what, Max?

00:54:30.571 --> 00:54:32.673
No, thank you.

00:54:32.807 --> 00:54:34.575
I think we need the Bible
as a weapon.

00:54:34.709 --> 00:54:36.844
Yeah, dude, not against
a masked maniac, though.

00:54:36.978 --> 00:54:38.913
But we're not just up
against that psycho.

00:54:39.046 --> 00:54:40.848
Every single night something new
is trying to kill us.

00:54:40.982 --> 00:54:42.482
Yeah, but why?

00:54:43.951 --> 00:54:45.019
Think about it.

00:54:45.153 --> 00:54:47.487
If it was the same thing
over and over again,

00:54:47.622 --> 00:54:50.625
you'd become
less scared over time.

00:54:50.758 --> 00:54:54.095
But what's more terrifying than
not knowing what comes next.

00:54:54.862 --> 00:54:55.830
Whoever,

00:54:56.429 --> 00:54:57.598
whatever,

00:54:57.732 --> 00:54:58.933
is doing this...

00:55:00.067 --> 00:55:01.301
it wants to keep us afraid.

00:55:01.434 --> 00:55:02.770
Yeah, well, it's working.

00:55:04.639 --> 00:55:05.807
I think I found something.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.975
I don't think that's gonna
help us. A VHS tape?

00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:09.544
Knowledge is power.

00:55:16.117 --> 00:55:17.118
Great, that's exactly

00:55:17.251 --> 00:55:18.553
-what we need right now.
-Wow.

00:55:18.686 --> 00:55:20.087
Uh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:55:20.221 --> 00:55:21.454
Very powerful, Max. Thank you.

00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:22.790
Just give me a second.
I have another one.

00:55:22.924 --> 00:55:24.959
Do you want us
to leave you alone for a second?

00:55:25.092 --> 00:55:26.761
-Just shut up. Abe.
-All right, all right.

00:55:38.272 --> 00:55:39.674
Help!

00:55:55.957 --> 00:55:58.092
Please.

00:55:58.226 --> 00:56:01.494
What are you doing to me?
Why do I keep coming back?

00:56:03.363 --> 00:56:06.601
Why do you have these things
that keep killing me?

00:56:06.734 --> 00:56:08.669
Who are you?!

00:56:08.803 --> 00:56:10.872
What do you want from me?! Huh?

00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:16.510
The patient
showed signs of

00:56:16.644 --> 00:56:18.613
starvation and muscle atrophy.

00:56:18.746 --> 00:56:20.047
What's
happening to me?

00:56:20.181 --> 00:56:24.151
But most importantly,
intense fear, anxiety,

00:56:24.285 --> 00:56:27.588
feelings of hopelessness
and utter despair.

00:56:28.723 --> 00:56:31.993
Fortunately for my experiments,

00:56:32.126 --> 00:56:35.529
the trauma of the mining
disaster still lingers,

00:56:35.663 --> 00:56:39.466
affecting both survivors
and visitors.

00:56:44.404 --> 00:56:46.207
The longer
he was trapped here,

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:49.377
the more desperate
and afraid he became...

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:52.847
and also the more monstrous.

00:56:55.216 --> 00:56:57.450
Help! God, please!

00:56:57.585 --> 00:56:59.120
Eleven nights.

00:56:59.253 --> 00:57:02.356
That's the most
in my experiments so far.

00:57:07.995 --> 00:57:11.265
Soon, those emotions
began to affect his body

00:57:11.399 --> 00:57:13.901
in more interesting ways...

00:57:15.403 --> 00:57:18.438
...transforming into
a creature known

00:57:18.572 --> 00:57:20.341
as the Wendigo.

00:57:20.473 --> 00:57:23.344
It is no coincidence
that in psychology,

00:57:23.476 --> 00:57:26.547
the Wendigo represents
extreme hunger,

00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:29.116
extreme want.

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:37.258
That's what's happening to us.

00:57:38.225 --> 00:57:39.260
That's what we're becoming.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.928
Yeah.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:44.098
Now you're getting it.

00:57:47.435 --> 00:57:49.170
Let us out.

00:57:53.808 --> 00:57:55.109
Let us out!

00:57:55.242 --> 00:57:57.611
Oh,
there's a way out,

00:57:57.745 --> 00:58:00.181
but not without a price.

00:58:01.481 --> 00:58:03.184
-Ask him how.
-Abe!

00:58:04.118 --> 00:58:05.186
How?

00:58:05.319 --> 00:58:08.155
Someone always
has to die.

00:58:08.289 --> 00:58:12.159
Four of you can leave,
but one has to die.

00:58:12.293 --> 00:58:13.694
No.

00:58:13.828 --> 00:58:15.229
Nice try, asshole.

00:58:15.363 --> 00:58:17.031
Wait, hold on. I think we should
at least just hear him out.

00:58:17.164 --> 00:58:20.067
Why? Are you willing
to sacrifice yourself for us?

00:58:22.436 --> 00:58:23.471
No.

00:58:23.604 --> 00:58:24.839
We can't trust this guy.

00:58:24.972 --> 00:58:26.240
Which means our only real shot

00:58:26.374 --> 00:58:27.875
of getting out
of here is getting some answers,

00:58:28.009 --> 00:58:29.610
and the one
with the answers is Hill.

00:58:30.778 --> 00:58:33.314
He's here somewhere.
I can feel it.

00:59:04.311 --> 00:59:07.481
How is this supposed to help us?
The whole town was destroyed.

00:59:07.615 --> 00:59:08.682
He could be anywhere.

00:59:11.619 --> 00:59:12.720
No. Not "anywhere."

00:59:17.324 --> 00:59:18.259
He's there.

00:59:18.392 --> 00:59:19.427
Was there. And Nina just said

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.895
none of this even
exists anymore.

00:59:21.028 --> 00:59:23.397
So we just need to try
to get him out of hiding.

00:59:24.899 --> 00:59:26.367
I wanna see you. Face-to-face.

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.369
Clover, what are you doing?

00:59:28.502 --> 00:59:30.071
He's the key to all of this.

00:59:30.204 --> 00:59:32.339
That can
be arranged.

00:59:32.473 --> 00:59:35.376
But just you, Clover.
Not your friends.

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:36.744
-No.
-Clover, no.

00:59:36.877 --> 00:59:39.113
This is a trap,
just like everything else here.

00:59:39.246 --> 00:59:40.414
Actually, I think
it's a pretty good idea.

00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:42.083
Abe, just shut
the fuck up, okay?

00:59:42.216 --> 00:59:43.451
It's only night four. Clover,

00:59:43.584 --> 00:59:45.252
-you're gonna have more chances.
-We don't know that.

00:59:45.386 --> 00:59:47.254
All the other signatures
in the book go way past that.

00:59:47.388 --> 00:59:49.757
Guys, Abe is right.

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:52.293
-This is our chance.
-No. Don't listen to him.

00:59:52.426 --> 00:59:54.161
I'm out
in the woods.

00:59:54.295 --> 00:59:56.430
I'm here with your sister.

00:59:57.898 --> 01:00:00.034
I might just let you see her.

01:00:00.167 --> 01:00:01.735
-Clo.
-There you go. Yeah.

01:00:01.869 --> 01:00:03.437
-Clover, come on.
-No.

01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:05.574
I have to try.

01:00:05.706 --> 01:00:07.208
-No, no, no. Clover!
-Let her go!

01:00:07.341 --> 01:00:08.943
-Back off!
-Let her go, let her go!

01:00:09.076 --> 01:00:11.779
-What is wrong with you?
-What? Hey!

01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:13.714
Hey! Nina!

01:00:16.951 --> 01:00:18.252
You fucking prick!

01:00:18.385 --> 01:00:20.087
What?! I didn't think
she was gonna actually do it.

01:00:20.221 --> 01:00:21.590
Yes, you did. You knew she would

01:00:21.722 --> 01:00:23.424
and you took advantage.
Fucking coward!

01:00:23.558 --> 01:00:25.025
Look, Megan,
we need to find Clover

01:00:25.159 --> 01:00:26.227
before something
permanent happens.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.495
-To do what?
-We're gonna go find her.

01:00:27.628 --> 01:00:28.996
And if she's dead already,

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:32.900
we're gonna kill each other
and start over again.

01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:34.101
Sounds like a plan.

01:00:34.235 --> 01:00:35.169
Abe first.

01:00:35.302 --> 01:00:37.238
Wait-Wait! Just wait, hold on.

01:00:37.371 --> 01:00:38.839
Say we start over.

01:00:38.973 --> 01:00:40.908
What then?

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:43.244
We just keep running away
until we run out of chances?

01:00:43.377 --> 01:00:44.513
Are you fucking serious?

01:00:44.645 --> 01:00:46.013
I don't wanna live
knowing that I'm alive

01:00:46.147 --> 01:00:47.616
because someone else is dead!

01:00:47.748 --> 01:00:49.683
-Because Clover is dead!
-But look at us!

01:00:49.817 --> 01:00:53.020
How many more deaths
do you have in you? Be honest.

01:00:53.154 --> 01:00:56.056
I mean, didn't she try and kill
herself twice last year?

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:58.058
Isn't this just giving her
what she wa--?

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.537
What the fuck, Nina?!

01:01:08.669 --> 01:01:10.505
You guys go find Clover.

01:01:10.639 --> 01:01:12.206
Otherwise it'll be two people
we have to leave behind.

01:01:12.641 --> 01:01:13.642
Let's go.

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:24.919
You better hope they find her.

01:01:30.791 --> 01:01:31.892
I'm here!

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.994
You-you have me.

01:01:42.803 --> 01:01:44.506
No.

01:01:58.553 --> 01:02:00.054
Oh, no.

01:02:00.187 --> 01:02:03.791
No, please, please, please.
Please! Sh-- Please.

01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:05.859
No, no. No!

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:09.698
Please! Please! Please! Please!

01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:11.666
Please!

01:02:11.799 --> 01:02:14.703
No! Wait, wait!
Oh, my God.

01:02:25.446 --> 01:02:27.582
You need to try
and survive, Nina.

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:30.619
I will.

01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:33.120
Just not this time.

01:02:48.703 --> 01:02:50.871
I'm scared of dying, Nina.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.140
Like, really dying.

01:02:54.308 --> 01:02:55.510
Me too.

01:02:57.545 --> 01:02:59.980
But living without my friends
scares me even more.

01:03:05.219 --> 01:03:06.487
Him first.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.921
What?

01:03:14.395 --> 01:03:15.929
Clover!

01:03:16.063 --> 01:03:17.164
Clo.

01:03:28.942 --> 01:03:30.477
Holy shit.

01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:44.858
Clover?

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.294
Clover!

01:03:49.664 --> 01:03:50.931
Clover!

01:04:00.542 --> 01:04:02.744
Over there.

01:04:10.084 --> 01:04:11.985
The hell?

01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:14.254
Run!

01:04:22.963 --> 01:04:24.733
Max! Max!

01:04:29.537 --> 01:04:31.071
It'll break if I move.

01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:36.578
Okay, okay.
Just give me your hand.

01:04:38.847 --> 01:04:42.015
Okay, okay, I got you.
I'm gonna pull on three. Okay?

01:04:43.183 --> 01:04:44.151
Okay.

01:04:44.284 --> 01:04:45.919
One, two, three.

01:04:52.025 --> 01:04:52.993
Meg!

01:04:53.695 --> 01:04:55.095
Meg!

01:05:33.233 --> 01:05:34.669
Clover! Clover!

01:05:34.803 --> 01:05:35.770
Max!

01:05:35.904 --> 01:05:37.404
You're here.

01:05:37.539 --> 01:05:40.174
I got you. I got you.
Okay. Ready?

01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:43.110
Okay.

01:05:45.379 --> 01:05:47.314
I'm sorry. Aw, fuck.

01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:51.385
Max. Max. Max.

01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:57.892
Is that Melanie?

01:06:10.471 --> 01:06:12.973
-Come on. Come on.
-Melanie! No, no!

01:06:18.947 --> 01:06:20.314
I got you. I got you.

01:06:34.863 --> 01:06:35.897
Melanie!

01:06:42.035 --> 01:06:43.705
I fucked up, Max.

01:06:44.706 --> 01:06:45.673
What?

01:06:45.807 --> 01:06:46.975
-I fucked up.
-No.

01:06:47.107 --> 01:06:48.776
-Yes. Yes. Yes.
-No, no, no.

01:06:49.443 --> 01:06:50.444
Yeah.

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.549
Why did you come for me?

01:06:55.917 --> 01:06:57.552
You all could have escaped.

01:06:57.685 --> 01:07:00.722
No. No, no, no. We'll have
more chances to get out of this.

01:07:01.656 --> 01:07:03.257
Okay? Together.

01:07:05.259 --> 01:07:07.160
I'm not leaving you behind.

01:07:15.637 --> 01:07:16.804
When we die, like...

01:07:17.939 --> 01:07:20.207
for real...

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.476
you think we get the chance
to do it all again?

01:07:25.312 --> 01:07:26.581
I hope not.

01:07:27.682 --> 01:07:28.716
Why?

01:07:31.719 --> 01:07:34.421
Just means more somehow

01:07:34.556 --> 01:07:36.290
when you know
you only have one shot.

01:07:40.093 --> 01:07:41.696
Yeah.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.936
Are the others still alive?

01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:50.070
Um, I-I'm not sure
about Abe and Nina.

01:07:50.203 --> 01:07:51.204
What about Megan?

01:07:55.142 --> 01:07:56.611
Uh...

01:07:59.681 --> 01:08:01.583
What are you doing? I just said
I don't know about Abe and Nina.

01:08:01.716 --> 01:08:02.917
But we know that Megan is dead.

01:08:03.051 --> 01:08:05.620
That's enough
for me to try and start again.

01:08:08.188 --> 01:08:10.058
This next one might be our last.

01:08:12.259 --> 01:08:14.127
But I think
we can all survive, Max.

01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:17.431
So let's get started
by dying first.

01:08:17.565 --> 01:08:20.467
I know. I know. It's okay.

01:08:24.706 --> 01:08:26.406
Yeah.

01:08:32.179 --> 01:08:33.380
Thank you.

01:09:05.445 --> 01:09:06.446
Hey!

01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:08.783
Fuck y--!

01:09:18.092 --> 01:09:19.861
Uh, um...

01:09:19.994 --> 01:09:21.461
Just one second, Mel.

01:09:27.568 --> 01:09:29.604
Mel. Mel.

01:09:30.972 --> 01:09:33.173
Wait, hey. You should take this.

01:09:33.306 --> 01:09:34.408
No, Clover.

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:35.510
It was Mom's.
You should take it.

01:09:35.643 --> 01:09:38.813
No. You keep it.

01:09:38.946 --> 01:09:41.348
Um, well, do you wanna
wait out the storm at least?

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:42.984
I just wanna get going.

01:09:43.117 --> 01:09:46.353
It's a long way to New York.

01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.056
But then it's just me.

01:09:48.556 --> 01:09:49.991
Yeah.

01:09:50.124 --> 01:09:53.027
I mean, I've asked you to come
with me how many times now?

01:09:53.795 --> 01:09:54.762
Let's just leave.

01:09:55.495 --> 01:09:57.230
I told you that I can't.

01:09:57.364 --> 01:09:59.600
You can't sit still
for the rest of your life, Clo.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:01.903
It's not living.

01:10:02.036 --> 01:10:03.671
At least I'm not running away.

01:10:03.805 --> 01:10:05.506
You think that's what I'm doing,
running away?

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.941
I'm actually running
towards something.

01:10:07.075 --> 01:10:08.208
Towards what?

01:10:08.341 --> 01:10:11.813
School. A new city. A new life.

01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:12.914
I love you.

01:10:14.281 --> 01:10:15.850
But I can't just sit here

01:10:15.983 --> 01:10:18.019
and waste away
becoming something I'd hate.

01:10:28.629 --> 01:10:29.731
Mel.

01:10:30.732 --> 01:10:32.232
Mel, wait!

01:10:38.072 --> 01:10:40.240
Hey. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:10:46.446 --> 01:10:48.216
I-I had to drag you in here.

01:10:49.249 --> 01:10:50.484
I thought we lost you.

01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:54.122
Hey. Is there, uh...

01:10:55.022 --> 01:10:56.423
Is there something on my back?

01:11:02.462 --> 01:11:04.932
-You look fine.
-Are you sure?

01:11:05.066 --> 01:11:06.801
It feels like there's
something back there.

01:11:16.911 --> 01:11:18.445
How long have we been here?

01:11:20.114 --> 01:11:23.951
I don't know. Uh,
three or four nights, I think.

01:11:24.085 --> 01:11:25.153
Five, actually.

01:11:25.887 --> 01:11:26.821
It's been five.

01:11:26.954 --> 01:11:28.122
No, not five.

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:30.958
-Thirteen.
-What?

01:11:31.092 --> 01:11:32.593
It's been 13 nights.

01:11:34.128 --> 01:11:35.428
Go check the book.

01:11:54.982 --> 01:11:56.449
Yeah, nobody has more than 13.

01:11:59.419 --> 01:12:01.321
Tonight might be
our last chance.

01:12:16.103 --> 01:12:18.306
I don't remember
any of these things.

01:12:19.674 --> 01:12:21.175
Yeah, me neither.

01:12:22.143 --> 01:12:24.879
We didn't do what we said, Max.

01:12:25.012 --> 01:12:27.548
The next one wasn't the last and
neither was the one after that,

01:12:27.682 --> 01:12:29.016
or the one after that.

01:12:37.925 --> 01:12:38.993
Wait.

01:12:40.493 --> 01:12:41.494
Where's Megan?

01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:46.667
Shit. Megan.

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:53.774
She's not in there.

01:12:53.908 --> 01:12:55.408
Maybe something
already happened to her?

01:12:55.543 --> 01:12:57.377
Or it got to her first.

01:12:57.511 --> 01:12:58.579
What? What got to her?

01:12:59.313 --> 01:13:00.514
The night.

01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:06.453
Survive the night
or become a part of it.

01:13:06.587 --> 01:13:07.755
There's nothing that says
it would happen

01:13:07.889 --> 01:13:09.056
to all of us at the same time.

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.092
Because there's nothing
that says anything, Abe.

01:13:11.225 --> 01:13:12.260
I know, but different people
could have

01:13:12.425 --> 01:13:13.361
a different number of chances,

01:13:13.493 --> 01:13:14.461
like it's random.

01:13:15.196 --> 01:13:17.064
You could be right.

01:13:17.198 --> 01:13:21.002
Okay. Okay, great.
So then what do we do, huh?

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:23.571
Megan is just-- She's gone?

01:13:23.704 --> 01:13:26.274
Fuck. Why can't we
remember anything?

01:13:26.406 --> 01:13:27.875
Why didn't we write
anything down?

01:13:28.009 --> 01:13:29.243
Would it
have mattered?

01:13:29.377 --> 01:13:31.178
It'd be gone once
the night starts over anyway.

01:13:31.312 --> 01:13:33.014
Your signature isn't.

01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:34.115
But that's all
that's in there.

01:13:34.882 --> 01:13:36.284
Didn't I record something?

01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:42.290
Holy shit. Guys, come here.

01:13:49.263 --> 01:13:50.264
Look.

01:13:51.098 --> 01:13:52.432
There's so much stuff.

01:13:53.768 --> 01:13:54.802
What?

01:13:54.936 --> 01:13:56.436
Okay. All right.

01:13:58.406 --> 01:14:00.141
Don't worry. We'll get it.

01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:01.242
Okay.

01:14:01.375 --> 01:14:02.475
Just don't move.

01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:03.744
-I'm gonna grab it.
-Okay.

01:14:03.878 --> 01:14:05.980
-Oh, my God.
-Abe? Abe, be careful.

01:14:06.113 --> 01:14:07.515
-Please get it.
-Abe?

01:14:07.648 --> 01:14:09.817
What?

01:14:09.951 --> 01:14:11.519
Is it... is it gone?

01:14:12.452 --> 01:14:14.622
-Is it gone?
-Uh...

01:14:14.755 --> 01:14:16.123
Yeah. It's gone.

01:14:16.724 --> 01:14:17.992
Did it fall off?

01:14:20.594 --> 01:14:22.129
-What the fuck?!
-What?

01:14:22.263 --> 01:14:23.463
-Holy shit.
-Is it still on my face?

01:14:23.597 --> 01:14:25.433
Uh, uh, um...

01:14:25.566 --> 01:14:26.701
It's fine, it's fine.

01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:28.769
Clover,
it's okay, it's okay.

01:14:28.903 --> 01:14:30.338
Is-Is it still on my face?!

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:32.773
Oh, my God.

01:14:34.775 --> 01:14:36.277
Okay.

01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:39.146
Fuck. It's locked.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.348
Fuck.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.481
What's that?

01:14:42.783 --> 01:14:45.353
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?

01:14:45.485 --> 01:14:46.486
Is that a person?

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:47.655
Holy shit, holy shit.

01:14:47.788 --> 01:14:49.323
What the fuck?!

01:14:50.825 --> 01:14:52.560
Max. Man,
we should turn back.

01:15:01.469 --> 01:15:02.970
Look at all this shit.

01:15:03.104 --> 01:15:04.972
There's fucking blood
on the walls.

01:15:05.106 --> 01:15:06.540
Just be quiet, Abe.

01:15:10.544 --> 01:15:11.746
What the hell?

01:15:14.548 --> 01:15:16.050
Max!

01:15:17.818 --> 01:15:19.220
-Max! Max!
-Abe!

01:15:19.353 --> 01:15:20.955
Die! Die! Die!

01:15:21.088 --> 01:15:22.723
Max!

01:15:22.857 --> 01:15:24.525
Die! Die!

01:15:26.961 --> 01:15:29.296
Why won't you fucking die?!

01:15:33.334 --> 01:15:35.970
Oh, shit. What the fuck?

01:15:36.103 --> 01:15:37.204
What is that?

01:15:37.338 --> 01:15:39.874
-What the fuck is that?
-What is that?!

01:15:40.007 --> 01:15:41.909
-Nina!
-What the fuck?! No!

01:15:42.043 --> 01:15:43.477
-Nina!
-What is that?!

01:15:43.611 --> 01:15:45.413
Abe! What is that?!

01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:46.814
Holy shit!

01:16:36.531 --> 01:16:37.965
I'm gonna follow him

01:16:38.099 --> 01:16:40.801
and see if I can find out
anything that will help us.

01:16:41.435 --> 01:16:42.436
I have to try.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.161
Fuck.

01:17:07.294 --> 01:17:08.262
Oh, my God.
They're coming.

01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:10.599
Fuck. They're all coming.

01:17:12.133 --> 01:17:13.100
We need to run.

01:17:13.234 --> 01:17:15.269
All we've been doing
is running away.

01:17:15.402 --> 01:17:17.438
So let's start running
towards something.

01:17:17.572 --> 01:17:18.672
What do you mean?

01:17:24.979 --> 01:17:26.113
I'm going into that tunnel.

01:17:26.247 --> 01:17:28.282
Clover. We don't even know
what's over there.

01:17:28.415 --> 01:17:29.618
You realize this could
be our last night.

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:30.751
Good.

01:17:32.253 --> 01:17:34.121
It means more
when you only have one shot.

01:17:35.557 --> 01:17:37.191
I'm sorry I got you into this.

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:39.994
You're all here because of me.

01:17:41.662 --> 01:17:43.998
Melanie was my family,
but you're my family too.

01:17:44.131 --> 01:17:46.635
So I'm gonna save Megan,
kill Hill

01:17:46.767 --> 01:17:48.537
and then get us
the fuck out of here.

01:17:50.905 --> 01:17:52.173
I'm-I'm done with death.

01:18:08.389 --> 01:18:09.423
Clover.

01:18:13.662 --> 01:18:14.828
We stick together.

01:18:26.373 --> 01:18:27.875
Oh, fuck.

01:18:29.777 --> 01:18:30.744
Come on.

01:18:31.845 --> 01:18:33.247
Oh, my God.

01:18:50.565 --> 01:18:51.932
Whoa.

01:18:52.066 --> 01:18:53.434
Holy shit.

01:18:53.568 --> 01:18:54.868
This place is huge.

01:19:13.588 --> 01:19:14.955
Hey, careful.

01:19:28.135 --> 01:19:29.870
Watch your step.

01:19:39.446 --> 01:19:40.481
Come on.

01:20:31.832 --> 01:20:33.100
Is that...?

01:20:34.335 --> 01:20:35.770
Shh...

01:20:39.774 --> 01:20:41.108
Don't move.

01:21:03.063 --> 01:21:04.031
Go, go, go!

01:21:04.164 --> 01:21:06.233
Go! Go, go, go!

01:21:06.367 --> 01:21:08.068
Go! Go, go, go!

01:21:13.474 --> 01:21:14.509
Nina! Nina!

01:21:14.642 --> 01:21:15.844
-Go! Come on!
-Go, go, go!

01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:18.212
Come on, guys!

01:21:44.171 --> 01:21:46.907
Go, go, go! Go!

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.677
Guys, right here,
right here! Right here!

01:21:50.578 --> 01:21:53.280
Go! Go, go!

01:21:58.085 --> 01:22:00.020
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:22:00.154 --> 01:22:01.922
Huh?

01:22:02.055 --> 01:22:03.056
Oh, fuck.

01:22:10.865 --> 01:22:13.668
-Max. Max, Max!
-Go! We'll find another way!

01:22:13.802 --> 01:22:15.269
Max, no!

01:22:15.402 --> 01:22:16.604
Go! Go find Megan!

01:22:17.639 --> 01:22:19.607
Go! We'll make it out of here.

01:22:21.074 --> 01:22:22.976
Hey, asshole!

01:22:25.747 --> 01:22:27.014
Oh, fuck.

01:23:49.496 --> 01:23:50.965
Please don't do this. Mel.

01:23:55.335 --> 01:23:57.739
It's m-- It's me. It's me.

01:24:24.899 --> 01:24:26.133
I love you, Mel.

01:24:28.068 --> 01:24:30.437
But I'm getting the fuck out
of this hellhole.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.549
Max!

01:24:54.729 --> 01:24:55.697
Fuck.

01:24:59.067 --> 01:25:01.569
Fuck you, asshole. Die!

01:25:11.579 --> 01:25:12.947
Aw, fuck.

01:27:29.884 --> 01:27:30.818
Help!

01:27:30.952 --> 01:27:32.787
-Megan!
-Help!

01:27:36.724 --> 01:27:38.092
-Megan!
-Clover!

01:27:38.226 --> 01:27:39.227
Watch out!

01:27:51.072 --> 01:27:52.372
Megan, I'm gonna find a way

01:27:52.507 --> 01:27:53.574
out of here.
I'm gonna get a key, okay?

01:27:53.708 --> 01:27:54.709
Hurry!

01:28:35.348 --> 01:28:40.221
You have been
an intriguing patient, Clover.

01:28:44.258 --> 01:28:46.994
Far more interesting
than the rest.

01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:50.031
Severe depression,

01:28:51.098 --> 01:28:54.035
two failed suicide attempts,

01:28:54.168 --> 01:28:56.503
extreme anxiety...

01:28:57.305 --> 01:28:59.307
You've lost control, Clover.

01:28:59.439 --> 01:29:03.044
And that's evident by every
monster you've encountered here.

01:29:03.978 --> 01:29:06.147
You see, they each represent

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.382
a unique manifestation
of your psyche.

01:29:11.484 --> 01:29:12.787
What are you talking about?

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:16.190
Being chased
by a masked psycho is common.

01:29:16.324 --> 01:29:19.660
Everyone feels powerless
in some way.

01:29:19.794 --> 01:29:25.032
And the witch is, of course,
a personification of repression.

01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:28.870
Now, the spontaneous
combustion...

01:29:29.003 --> 01:29:32.273
Very rare, Clover.

01:29:32.974 --> 01:29:34.508
I think it's a nod

01:29:34.642 --> 01:29:38.512
to your more
self-destructive tendencies.

01:29:38.646 --> 01:29:40.915
Fuck you.

01:29:41.048 --> 01:29:42.750
I am getting my friends
out of here.

01:29:42.884 --> 01:29:45.920
Well, you're the only one
who can, Clover.

01:29:47.021 --> 01:29:48.388
This place...

01:29:49.857 --> 01:29:55.596
is drawing on your
insecurities and your fears.

01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:58.933
I'm sorry, are you telling me
that this was all in my head?

01:29:59.066 --> 01:30:00.433
Is none,
is none of this real?

01:30:00.568 --> 01:30:02.370
Of course it's real.

01:30:02.502 --> 01:30:06.374
But you are the engine
that makes it run,

01:30:06.507 --> 01:30:08.943
just like Melanie
and all the others

01:30:09.076 --> 01:30:12.213
made it run, run, run, run.

01:30:20.021 --> 01:30:21.923
Help! Help!

01:30:22.056 --> 01:30:23.190
You hear that,
Clover?

01:30:23.324 --> 01:30:26.294
Your friends
are all about to die again.

01:30:26.426 --> 01:30:29.397
Tick, tick, tick...

01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:31.132
Why? Why are you doing this?

01:30:32.233 --> 01:30:33.267
Why?

01:30:34.368 --> 01:30:37.138
Because this is what I study.

01:30:37.772 --> 01:30:40.741
Fear is my trade.

01:30:40.875 --> 01:30:45.513
People with trauma,
like yourself, Clover...

01:30:45.646 --> 01:30:51.152
And places with trauma,
like Glore Valley...

01:30:51.285 --> 01:30:53.587
When I put
the two of them together...

01:30:54.155 --> 01:30:55.656
ah...

01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:58.259
trauma becomes terror...

01:30:59.193 --> 01:31:00.428
and sparks...

01:31:00.962 --> 01:31:02.163
ignite.

01:31:05.433 --> 01:31:07.401
Help!
Shit, guys, I'm fucking stuck!

01:31:10.271 --> 01:31:11.672
And it creates...

01:31:12.573 --> 01:31:13.841
the perfect...

01:31:15.076 --> 01:31:16.143
horror.

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.629
Fuck, they're coming!
Please help! Please!

01:31:40.301 --> 01:31:42.636
But to make this

01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:44.504
truly effective

01:31:44.638 --> 01:31:47.308
like I've said before,

01:31:47.441 --> 01:31:50.211
someone always has to die.

01:31:50.344 --> 01:31:52.146
They're fucking coming! Hurry!

01:32:01.522 --> 01:32:02.590
Yeah.

01:32:03.124 --> 01:32:04.458
But this time...

01:32:04.592 --> 01:32:05.559
it's you.

01:32:35.356 --> 01:32:38.192
Clover!

01:32:39.026 --> 01:32:40.294
Hurry!

01:32:50.204 --> 01:32:51.472
Go.

01:32:52.173 --> 01:32:53.374
Go, go, go.

01:33:17.932 --> 01:33:19.100
The ladder.

01:33:20.501 --> 01:33:21.469
Come on!

01:33:30.878 --> 01:33:33.280
There's a way up!

01:33:36.217 --> 01:33:37.586
Come on, get up.

01:34:06.113 --> 01:34:07.281
Clover!

01:34:07.414 --> 01:34:08.983
No! No!

01:34:21.228 --> 01:34:22.296
Clover!

01:34:22.429 --> 01:34:24.298
We got you, we got you.

01:34:27.067 --> 01:34:28.702
Megan!

01:34:48.489 --> 01:34:49.490
What's happening?

01:34:52.293 --> 01:34:55.162
Look. Look. The sky.

01:35:14.848 --> 01:35:15.983
We did it.

01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:18.219
It's over.

01:35:23.658 --> 01:35:25.059
Jesus!

01:35:25.192 --> 01:35:27.328
You guys planning on staying
another night, or what?

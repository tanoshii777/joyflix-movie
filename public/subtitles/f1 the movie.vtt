WEBVTT

00:54.471 --> 00:56.056
Hey, Sonny. Five minutes.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.520
Sonny! Hey.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.189
BMW guys are over there
bitching about brake trouble.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.774
Thanks, Molly.
You're a superstar.

01:47.857 --> 01:48.817
I'll see you out there.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.133
Turn my back for one minute.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.971
It's all gone to shit, Sonny.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.430
Pat had to ease off.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.391
We've dropped down to seventh.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.852
If you can just
hold position overnight,

02:23.935 --> 02:25.687
hopeful sunrise
catches us a break.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.320
Sonny, watch that high-speed balance.
High-speed balance.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.243
How's the gearbox?

02:40.326 --> 02:41.411
It's holding up, but go easy.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.934
The crowds may have
gone home, but the racing continues.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.104
Sonny Hayes back in the Porsche
for Peak Geico Chip Hart Racing,

03:08.188 --> 03:09.898
the midnight shift.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.274
We all know Hayes

03:11.357 --> 03:12.567
likes to light up the night,

03:12.650 --> 03:15.028
but with the BMW
at the head of this pack,

03:15.111 --> 03:16.487
he's got a massive job
ahead of him.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.920
Right out of the gate,
Hayes threads the needle into turn three,

03:32.003 --> 03:33.171
moving up to fourth place.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.089
Sonny, wanna maybe
pass on the straights?

03:35.173 --> 03:36.216
Just let me drive, will ya?

03:40.803 --> 03:42.513
Look out.
Engine trouble for the number 12.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.435
That moves Hayes
up another spot.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.120
Sweet baby Jesus.
We got ten more hours.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.665
Just let Sonny do his thing.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.125
And if these first few laps
are any indication,

04:11.209 --> 04:14.796
it appears as though Sonny Hayes may
have left his brake pedal at home.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.550
Hayes sets his sights
on the BMW.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.138
And he attacks.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.978
Here comes
Hayes on the outside.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.271
Come on, Sonny.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.802
The BMW late on the brakes.
He's in the grass.

05:07.682 --> 05:08.641
Can Hayes hang on?

05:10.393 --> 05:11.394
And he does.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.396
Goddamn!

05:13.479 --> 05:15.690
See that?
That's how you race, boys.

05:15.773 --> 05:18.484
When you get back in that car,
you need to do the same goddamn thing.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.617
Sonny Hayes brings it
into pit lane after an epic third stint

05:26.701 --> 05:29.620
that puts Chip Hart Racing
out in front.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.457
Now, it's up to Cale Kelso
to hang on to that lead.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.875
Thanks for
the head start, Chief.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.672
Hey. Lose that lead,
I'll kill ya.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.639
Hayes!

05:49.349 --> 05:50.600
Hey, dirtbag!

05:52.685 --> 05:54.228
Gonna run me
off the track, Hayes?

05:54.312 --> 05:55.772
It's not worth it.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.775
You think I don't know
where to find you? Screw you!

06:00.443 --> 06:01.361
Let go of me!

06:04.030 --> 06:05.531
Hey. Attaboy, Sonny.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.118
Thanks.
Don't wake me if we lose.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.511
Sonny Hayes,
I believe you forgot something.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.596
Bag's full, Chip.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.224
Seriously?

06:31.307 --> 06:33.851
Your first win at Daytona.
Don't you even want to touch it?

06:33.935 --> 06:35.061
-Ooh, bad luck.
-Come on.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.687
-Just touch it.
-No. Hey.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.899
I will take
that bonus check though.

06:41.484 --> 06:45.405
Sonny. Sonny! Just hear me out.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.740
Look, I wanna bring
you on board.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.367
You're CHR family now.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.244
Right here, next year,
let's run it back.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.162
We did it, man. Deal's a deal.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.206
I-I know what a deal is.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.584
So that's it? One and done?

06:58.668 --> 07:01.421
I appreciate the seat, Chip.
I really do.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.423
What kind of way
is that to race?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.174
You just spend your whole life
starting over, man.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.259
You take care.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.387
I'll see you down the road.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.272
Hey! Don't you want the watch?

07:19.355 --> 07:20.481
Got one!

07:22.400 --> 07:24.110
WHOG, Ormond-by-the-Sea.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.361
Proud to be locally owned.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.029
A Southern Stone station.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.198
The world's most
famous rock...

07:29.282 --> 07:31.701
...from the
world's most famous beach, we are...

07:31.784 --> 07:33.703
...Daytona's rock station...

07:33.786 --> 07:35.121
...ninety-five seven, the Hog.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.515
Sorry, can I use your phone
for a second, please?

07:54.599 --> 07:55.808
It's not working.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.685
Um, no.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.816
You know, you remind me
of this friend I used to have.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.193
Which friend?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.611
Friend who dressed better.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.155
This is a Gucci suit.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.406
So's this.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.408
Huh. What did your friend do?

08:12.492 --> 08:13.534
Drove cars.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.578
-Was he fast?
-Wasn't slow.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.456
-Did he win?
-Yeah, he did.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.919
Come here, you son of a bitch.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.253
Oh, God.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.005
Are you thinking Baja?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.216
Yeah.
New day, new challenge.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.676
That's exactly what I said to
myself when I bought Apex GP.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.639
How deep in the hole are you?

08:36.140 --> 08:38.184
I'll tell you, but you have
to promise not to laugh.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.019
Shoot.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.272
350...

08:44.899 --> 08:46.317
million.

08:48.861 --> 08:49.695
Don't laugh.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.490
Impressive.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.034
Well, been fun?

08:55.117 --> 08:57.370
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.746
What's the problem then?

08:58.829 --> 09:01.958
Problem is two seasons
and a half, zero points.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.210
My best driver
left for another team.

09:04.293 --> 09:06.379
He said the car was a shitbox.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.423
The team is in last place.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.467
My number two's a rookie.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.885
And the season's half over.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.971
-How many races left?
-Nine.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.014
And if we don't turn it around,
I lose the team.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.474
-What?
-Mmm.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.434
But you own the team.

09:20.518 --> 09:24.355
No race wins in your first three
seasons, the board can force a sale.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.650
Man, sounds like
you need a new board.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.695
I need a new driver.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.372
You got F2. You got F3.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.666
You got an entire assembly line
of kids raised on the simulator.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.919
No, I don't have time for some kid to
learn how to come in tenth. I don't.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.589
Well, you don't just walk off
the street and pilot a rocket.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.425
Yes, you can if you've done it before.
That's the whole point.

09:52.508 --> 09:56.345
Louis Chiron was 57 years old
when he won the Monaco Grand Prix.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.889
-Louis who?
-Philippe Etancelin, 56 years old.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.766
You just Googled
these names, didn't you?

10:00.850 --> 10:03.728
Some people look at Sonny Hayes,
they see a guy who lives in a van,

10:03.811 --> 10:05.896
a gambling junkie
who missed his shot.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.149
Wow, Ruben,
you are really selling this.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.443
But I see a guy
who makes teams better.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.528
-I see experience. I see know-how.
-Mmm.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.946
You're off your meds.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.365
My rookie's a phenomenal talent.
Phenomenal.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.617
But he's young.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.993
You know what he lacks?
Maturity.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.370
You plus him?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.956
Boom. I got a team.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.791
All right.
Let's say I'm the next Louis...

10:25.875 --> 10:27.460
-Chiron. Mm-hmm.
-Him.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.921
The problem is it's not
just the driver, it's the car.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.799
I've followed
your season, Ruben.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.343
"Shitbox" is being kind.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.469
I knew you were watching.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.803
What if I told you

10:37.887 --> 10:39.513
we get an upgrade package
this weekend?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.349
-Six months in development--
-Ruben...

10:41.432 --> 10:43.100
No, no, no. Wait.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.646
I just need one of my cars across
the finish line first. One.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.023
I love ya. I'm not going back.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.195
Okay.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.492
What would he want you to do?

11:01.577 --> 11:03.245
Join a boy band?

11:03.329 --> 11:04.789
Seriously. Come on.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.085
Seriously, I'd ask him
what he's smiling about.

11:09.168 --> 11:09.919
Come on.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.172
He's smiling
at the possibility.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.676
We both know how that ended.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.470
Yep.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.348
Okay.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.768
-This is a first-class ticket to London.
-Oh, my God.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.144
First class.

11:27.228 --> 11:30.606
I'm offering you
an open seat in Formula 1.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.402
The only place
you could say for one day,

11:34.485 --> 11:39.532
if you win, you are the
absolute best in the world.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.002
-Hey, Ruben.
-Mmm.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.796
-Ever seen a miracle?
-Not yet.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.673
Me neither.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.925
Good to see you, amigo.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.304
-All right, sweetie, here you go.
-Thank you.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.432
-Mm-hmm.
-Hey, let me ask you something.

12:06.976 --> 12:11.480
Close friend of yours made you an
offer that was 100%, positively

12:11.564 --> 12:12.648
too good to be true.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.859
What do you do?

12:14.942 --> 12:17.486
Well,
how much are we talking?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.821
Not about the money.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.907
So what is it about?

12:23.075 --> 12:23.909
Hmm.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.496
Tire temps look good.
Eighty-five front, 75 rear.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.706
-You are good to push.
-Copy.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.675
Battery is full.
You're good for strat two.

13:21.759 --> 13:22.510
Going for a lap.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.488
Purple sector one.
Best one yet.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.240
Car feels good.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.027
Damn!

14:26.115 --> 14:27.867
Locked it up.
Flat spot, front left.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.459
Bring him in.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.003
Go to strat one.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.796
Uh, box this lap. Box this lap.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.978
Let's go find those gremlins.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.308
Sorry, Joshua.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.355
Jodie, try not
to kill our driver.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.530
What's the verdict?

15:48.614 --> 15:52.534
I don't know what's happening.
I mean, it feels good. I start to push.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.870
Then it understeers in the slow
corners and oversteers the fast.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.413
What? On entries or exits?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.040
Either. Both.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.084
Oh, great. Yeah.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.378
There's 10,000 sensors on this thing
and you can't tell me what's going on.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.213
But I'm not out there, am I?

16:04.296 --> 16:07.174
So, I-I'm gonna need
your help on this. Please.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.235
150 million dollar jungle gym.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.654
So cute.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.407
We should let her drive.
Can't be any worse.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.995
Joshua.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.414
-Hi.
-Lisbeth. PR?

16:38.497 --> 16:40.332
-Oh, yeah.
-Doesn't matter.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.960
For the press conference,
we want to steer around tech issues

16:43.043 --> 16:46.422
and focus on the super strong bond
with your new teammate, Luca Cortez.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.173
Luca?

16:48.257 --> 16:50.384
Who I've known a week.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.428
Who when he was third banana
on the left at Red Bull,

16:52.511 --> 16:54.847
told the press he thought
Joshua Pearce was overrated.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.474
That Luca Cortez?

16:57.558 --> 16:59.143
Yes.

16:59.226 --> 17:02.146
-Can't wait. Yeah.
-All right. Great. Thank you.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.272
-Yo.
-Yep.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.607
That's a yes?
Yeah? Yes?

17:05.691 --> 17:06.734
What's up?

17:06.817 --> 17:08.944
Yo, you were right, bro.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.363
Ruben's in big trouble.
He might have to sell the team.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.282
I knew it.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.575
And what does that mean for me?

17:14.658 --> 17:16.869
New buyers,
they're likely to clean house.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.080
Listen.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.751
You need to show these people who
the number one driver really is, man.

17:24.543 --> 17:25.294
Now.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.797
Or you're gonna lose your job.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.759
Yeah. Let that sink in.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.847
Hey.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.308
You good?

17:41.977 --> 17:46.065
Okay, let's take
the first half of the season

17:46.148 --> 17:48.150
and erase it from our minds.

17:49.651 --> 17:52.237
Someone says, "Kaspar,
what happened this year?"

17:52.321 --> 17:56.158
I swear on the lives of my
children, I do not freaking know.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.495
There's only this car.

17:59.578 --> 18:03.165
And there is only our future.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.001
Yes. Our future.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.678
Who is that asshole?

18:16.762 --> 18:17.513
He's with me.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.140
Your man thought
I was maintenance.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.517
Sent me to the back gate.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.646
Brother, you have never
let me down.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.606
Well, there's still time.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.441
Apex GP!

18:29.525 --> 18:31.860
Sonny Hayes.
He raced with me back in the day.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.654
-Against you, you mean.
-Yeah.

18:33.737 --> 18:36.365
-Kate McKenna, our technical director.
-Hi.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.368
-Dodge Dauda, our chief mechanic.
-Hi.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.411
And Kaspar Smolinski,
team principal.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.205
You may know him by reputation.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.707
Five-time Constructors champion
with Ferrari.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.543
Huh.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.711
As a rear jack man.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.630
So was my pop.
Can't win without 'em.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.299
-And our talented rookie, Joshua.
-Why has he got a helmet?

18:55.384 --> 18:57.261
Uh, safety?

18:57.344 --> 18:59.847
Joshua,
your seat is safe. Okay?

18:59.930 --> 19:01.557
Sonny is here for the audition.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.644
When was the last time
you won a race?

19:05.727 --> 19:07.271
Sunday. Daytona.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.273
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I meant Formula 1.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.692
Oh, I'm sorry.
Then same as you.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.820
Wow.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.573
Never thought I'd say this,
has anyone seen Luca Cortez?

19:17.656 --> 19:19.700
Sidebar bitte, Ruben.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.744
When I interview with you,
many veteran drivers--

19:22.828 --> 19:24.329
Yeah, who all turned you down.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.123
-How many?
-Seven.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.916
-That's a lot.
-I'm number seven?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.293
-Mm-hmm.
-You're eight.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.711
This is a disaster.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.254
Starting to feel
more like a nine.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.922
Technically, there is one
who I've not heard from yet.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.174
So I am a nine?

19:35.257 --> 19:36.758
You know how
numbers work, right?

19:36.842 --> 19:39.761
In business,
my most inspired ideas come late.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.556
Yeah. Best things in life
usually arrive ninth, right?

19:42.639 --> 19:45.934
With respect, Ruben, I cannot
condone we spend our only test day

19:46.018 --> 19:47.936
giving your long-lost teammate
an audition.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.479
Kaspar, you misunderstand.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.732
We're not auditioning him.
He's auditioning us.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.651
That's your new driver.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.569
Good luck.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.324
New wing, new side pods.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.700
Any changes to the floor?

20:03.368 --> 20:05.704
Nothing the eight other drivers
wouldn't have figured out.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.498
That's why they call me
Lucky Number Nine.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.335
Listen, it's been a while since
you've driven here, mate. Yeah?

20:11.418 --> 20:13.503
The balance on these cars are tricky,
so be careful turn one and nine.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.339
Wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.133
How about we set
a reasonable target?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.052
Give me the same setup as him.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.970
If I can't post a lap time
within a second of JP's,

20:22.054 --> 20:23.680
then I will promptly
see myself out

20:23.764 --> 20:26.225
and you're free to take a shot
at lucky number ten.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.935
-Ten?
-Ten.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.561
Ten.

20:31.813 --> 20:32.940
Who's JP?

20:37.194 --> 20:39.821
Cross round on Brooklands,
easy on Luffield.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.157
Up to Woodcote,
hard out in Copse.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.367
And be careful on the curve.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.791
Default mode, settings one,
to two, back to three.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.502
Differential one through four.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.670
DRS.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.032
Okay. Let's see what you got.

21:31.665 --> 21:36.378
If he raced with Ruben,
he raced with Schumacher. With Senna.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.452
All right,
pull up Joshua's sector times.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.088
Twenty quid says he stacks it.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.465
Make it a hundred, you're on.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.925
Oh, shit.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.514
Sorry, uh, this is Hugh
Nickleby, your race engineer.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.641
Good morning, Hugh.
How are my tire temps looking?

22:31.725 --> 22:34.269
Yep, almost warm. End of the
lap, you should be good to push.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.497
Right. Man.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.708
-Hugh?
-Yes, sir?

22:56.792 --> 22:58.502
You should've taken that bet.

22:58.585 --> 22:59.753
Copy that.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.224
Going for a lap.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.327
Nope. Shit.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.453
He's dead.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.164
Come on. Don't do that.

23:37.916 --> 23:38.917
And buried.

24:18.707 --> 24:19.583
Wait.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.044
Wait.

24:26.047 --> 24:27.591
Now.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.304
The car is there, come on.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.226
He's gaining.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.603
Ah, shit.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.034
You okay?

24:54.117 --> 24:56.578
Yep. All good.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.176
Oh!

25:12.344 --> 25:15.347
Come on.

25:15.430 --> 25:16.640
Yeah, she's got something.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.058
Yeah, you mean had something.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.853
But definitely snappy
in the high-speed corners.

25:21.937 --> 25:22.854
Unpredictable in the lows.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.358
Had trouble with the rears,
turns 14, 16--

25:26.441 --> 25:27.817
And the final turn, maybe?

25:27.901 --> 25:30.445
-No, that's on me.
-What was his lap time?

25:30.529 --> 25:35.450
He passed his entirely self-imposed
test by five hundredths of a second.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.371
Huh.

25:42.624 --> 25:43.667
Well...

25:45.502 --> 25:46.795
...it's a start.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.848
Bro, we got nine races to catch
the eye of another team, you know.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.227
And as your manager,
I have to advise you

26:02.310 --> 26:04.646
that we need to start hitting
these social and sponsor events.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.398
You need more engagement, Josh,
more followers.

26:06.481 --> 26:08.316
-All right, deal.
-All right, cool. I'm just saying, innit?

26:09.401 --> 26:10.569
You eaten? I'm starving.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.571
Nah.

26:12.654 --> 26:13.989
Gotta see someone though.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.700
Yeah? Hey, take a picture,
post that shit.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.243
Send it to me,
I'll post that shit.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.869
It's my mum.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.454
Don't you dare post that shit.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.708
I knew you was gonna say that.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.263
Okay, baby?

26:38.346 --> 26:39.681
Yeah. Just tired.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.142
Bad tires or the engine?

26:43.560 --> 26:44.728
Come on, Mum.
You don't know about the cars.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.355
Facety.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.400
All right, I may not know much about
cars, but I know a lot about you.

26:50.984 --> 26:51.985
Go.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.990
I might lose my seat
if the team don't win a race.

26:58.241 --> 26:58.992
Any race.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.369
There are other teams?

27:01.453 --> 27:02.787
Yeah, there's 20 seats,
but they're all filled.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.124
Plus, there's this new guy,
and...

27:06.207 --> 27:06.958
...he's old.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.543
How old?

27:08.627 --> 27:11.046
Like, really old. Like... 80.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.051
He's such an arsehole, Mum.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.011
He's quick, though.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.221
Don't mind that.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.015
Focus on you.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.142
You can spend your whole life
worrying about other people,

27:24.225 --> 27:26.436
but your time is right now.

27:28.396 --> 27:29.564
You still love it?

27:31.232 --> 27:32.651
Course I still love it.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.778
Then remember what
your father used to say.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.947
"Put your head down and drive."

27:39.157 --> 27:40.408
Yes, ma'am.

28:04.724 --> 28:07.227
Come on, then. It's all good.
Come on. Come on, then.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.104
Come on. Come on.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.690
-Come here. Come on, then.
-You're kiddin' me.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.569
Don't park there.
It's just a car. Quieten down.

28:16.653 --> 28:17.696
Come on, eh? Come on.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.417
Thought your job was to build
the fastest car on the planet.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.794
My job is wind.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.630
So, helps to feel it.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.049
Mmm.

28:39.759 --> 28:42.262
Mysterious moves at Apex GP,

28:42.345 --> 28:45.974
who have finally announced the driver
who will take their second seat.

28:46.057 --> 28:49.227
And in a bizarre twist,
it's American Sonny Hayes,

28:49.310 --> 28:52.397
who hasn't raced in Formula 1
for over three decades.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.441
Son of an IndyCar mechanic,

28:54.524 --> 28:57.569
Hayes was considered something
of a reckless young phenomenon,

28:57.652 --> 29:00.238
the greatest who never was.

29:00.321 --> 29:03.074
His former career being
brought to an abrupt halt

29:03.158 --> 29:06.244
by a horrific accident
at the Spanish Grand Prix.

29:06.327 --> 29:09.622
He reappeared a decade later
in racing championships

29:09.706 --> 29:13.126
as diverse as Le Mans,
NASCAR, the Dakar Rally,

29:13.209 --> 29:15.837
and even a stint as
a New York taxi driver.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.089
Oh, no.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.175
But now he's back
racing for a team which has,

29:20.258 --> 29:24.679
in its entire F1 history,
never even finished in the top ten.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.723
None of this
will dampen speculation

29:26.806 --> 29:31.186
that majority shareholder Cervantes
Capital are looking to sell the team.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.897
And if they do,
that will likely also bring an end

29:33.980 --> 29:36.649
to the career
of F1 rookie Joshua Pearce.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.443
-Can we go now?
-"Desperate times," they say,

29:38.526 --> 29:40.028
"call for desperate measures,"

29:40.111 --> 29:42.781
but I honestly cannot recall
a driver signing

29:42.864 --> 29:44.574
-quite as desperate as this.
-Let's go.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.703
Boy, look at my son.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.747
-Huh?
-Hey.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.499
-That's the one.
-Huh.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.876
That's the other driver?

29:54.959 --> 29:57.670
Yep. That's him
and his stupid face.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.131
But, wait, you said he was old.
He not that old.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.758
Hey, Josh.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.384
You want a next shot anywhere?

30:03.468 --> 30:05.970
Nine races means nine times
you have to beat Chuck Norris.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.642
For now, start by winning
over the press.

30:10.725 --> 30:12.560
-Yeah? You ready?
-Mm-hmm.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.395
Cool. Let's go.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.772
Mmm.

30:15.855 --> 30:18.399
That's a handsome man
right there.

30:20.652 --> 30:25.824
Joshua. Hey. Um, it's been
an undeniably messy start to your season.

30:25.907 --> 30:31.704
No wins, car problems throughout,
and now you have another new teammate.

30:31.788 --> 30:32.747
How exactly are you finding it?

30:34.457 --> 30:37.418
Messy start doesn't mean you
can't finish neat. All right?

30:37.502 --> 30:40.964
Apex have a fire crew of engineers,
so I'm confident we'll come back fightin'.

30:41.047 --> 30:44.008
In terms of new teammates,

30:44.092 --> 30:47.178
I think it's really wonderful that Apex
are giving second chances to the elderly.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.851
Ah, yes. Next question.
Thank you. Yes, Don. Yeah.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.603
Mr. Hayes. Hi. Don Cavendish.
Um, welcome back to the UK.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.146
It's been a while, mmm?

30:57.230 --> 30:59.107
I mean, last time
you raced at Silverstone,

30:59.190 --> 31:02.527
Bill Clinton was your president,
and we were all dancing the Macarena.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.863
So, uh, it must be surreal to be back.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.283
Yeah.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.288
And, uh, during that decade,
you gave up racing,

31:13.371 --> 31:15.373
and, uh,
gambled professionally?

31:15.456 --> 31:17.166
Uh-huh.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.711
Before declaring yourself
personally bankrupt?

31:19.794 --> 31:21.170
Yep.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.881
You had
a marriage annulled

31:22.964 --> 31:24.173
and two more ended in divorce?

31:24.257 --> 31:25.425
Yep.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.053
Anything you wish
you'd done differently?

31:30.805 --> 31:31.806
Yeah.

31:34.475 --> 31:37.604
No more questions.
Thank you. Yes. Thank you.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.100
Yes, Dodge.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.522
What time was he here?

33:02.605 --> 33:03.398
Before me.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.657
And before you.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.671
Okay, here he comes. Apologize.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.840
Apologize?
I can't do that.

33:28.923 --> 33:31.676
-How you mean? Why not?
-Because it's a sign of weakness.

33:31.759 --> 33:32.593
It's a sign of strength.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.512
Sign of weakness.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.097
You hard ears, just do it.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.515
Mum, I can't.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.100
You can. You will.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.196
Hey, man.

33:54.073 --> 33:56.367
Other day at the press conference,
stuff I said wasn't cool.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.329
You say sorry.

34:00.413 --> 34:05.543
So, basically what I'm trying
to say is... I'm sorry.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.128
It's all right.
You're just worried I'm quicker than you.

34:07.211 --> 34:08.046
Hi, I'm Sonny.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.591
Oh, Bernadette Pearce.
Nice to meet you.

34:11.674 --> 34:13.926
Pleasure. It's all good.
I'll see you out there.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.647
How are you feeling?

34:26.731 --> 34:28.149
-So good.
-Good.

34:31.444 --> 34:32.320
-You good?
-Good.

34:32.904 --> 34:33.905
Good.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.074
No pressure.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.158
None.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.540
-Great.
-Great.

34:44.624 --> 34:45.374
Great.

34:46.834 --> 34:48.961
Welcome along
to Silverstone,

34:49.045 --> 34:54.217
the circuit where on the 13th of May 1950
the Formula 1 World Championship began.

34:54.300 --> 34:58.596
Today, we kick off the final nine races
of this thrilling championship season

34:58.679 --> 35:01.933
here at the 77th
British Grand Prix.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.352
As always,
11 teams will take the grid,

35:04.435 --> 35:06.604
fielding two drivers each.

35:06.687 --> 35:10.191
With race order determined by the
qualifying times set yesterday.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.527
Red Bull will start on pole

35:12.610 --> 35:15.696
followed by the two McLarens
and two Ferraris.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.575
Drivers, two minutes
to national anthem.

35:48.396 --> 35:49.147
Sonny!

35:51.065 --> 35:52.525
Ah, Ruben.
Don't make me talk to the money.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.652
Come on, give me a moment.
Just smile and shake hands.

35:54.735 --> 35:56.320
He's an important member
of the board.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.030
Sonny, this is Peter Banning,

35:58.114 --> 35:59.157
-one of my investors.
-Hi.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.533
Hi.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.535
He knows absolutely
nothing about racing...

36:02.618 --> 36:05.079
-Yeah.
-...but he's my eyes and ears on the board.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.415
And, uh,
you're Ruben's Hail Mary.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.333
Now, that is an American
football term, right?

36:09.417 --> 36:10.877
The Hail Mary,
the long shot. The--

36:10.960 --> 36:12.253
I believe it's
a religious term, originally.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.337
That is true. That is true.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.339
I'm praying to them all.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.508
I'm the one guy on the board who
actually wants to keep the team.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.427
The rest are calling it,
you know, Ruben's Inferno.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.179
But, seriously, man,
I'm hooked.

36:21.262 --> 36:24.098
I've binged all of
Drive to Survive.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.059
I honestly don't think I've ever known
so much about car tires. It's incredible.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.102
I'm gonna get back
to my day job.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.146
-Okay.
-Okay.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.482
Hey, man. We're counting on you.
Good luck.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.960
What are you doing here, Sonny?

37:50.184 --> 37:52.979
And as the clock ticks
then to the top of the hour,

37:53.062 --> 37:55.523
it's time to get things
going here at Silverstone.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.400
It's formation lap first.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.819
One tour of the track
and a chance for the drivers

37:59.902 --> 38:02.238
to warm up their tires
and brakes.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.785
Oh, no.
There's a problem for Apex.

38:07.868 --> 38:11.205
That's Hayes in P22.
His car hasn't moved.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.165
Hang on. I got power trouble.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.793
It's start mode, Sonny.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.295
Start mode on.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.171
Yes,
a lesson for everyone at home.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.590
New car? Do read the manual.

38:21.674 --> 38:24.135
It's been a while since he
was out on the track. At this rate...

38:24.218 --> 38:25.886
-Dios mío.
-...he's not even gonna get into the race.

38:25.970 --> 38:26.971
Ay.

38:28.639 --> 38:29.765
I got it.

38:29.849 --> 38:30.599
All good.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.688
And he's away at last.
Thank goodness for that.

38:35.771 --> 38:38.024
If he falls too far
behind on the formation lap...

38:38.107 --> 38:39.650
-Drink?
-...he'll be at risk...

38:39.734 --> 38:41.485
-Eh? No.
-...of having to start in the pit lane.

38:42.695 --> 38:45.406
Where's Sonny?
He's holding us up.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.408
Yeah. Just checking, Joshua.
Just checking.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.828
-What's wrong with his car?
-What? Nothing.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.872
With a clear track ahead,

38:52.955 --> 38:55.833
Hayes has been able to push much
harder on this formation lap.

38:55.916 --> 38:58.919
He'll turn up at the back of the
grid with warm tires, ready to go.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.590
Cheeky shit. It's on purpose.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.722
What is this guy doing?

39:09.805 --> 39:13.059
This is actually now turning
into an advantage for Sonny Hayes.

39:13.142 --> 39:17.063
And he's just made it in time.
Watch out for his start.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.907
Five lights
ahead of the drivers.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.242
It's lights out and away we go!

39:43.547 --> 39:45.800
Here comes Sonny Hayes,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.678
Using those warm tires to carve his
way through the back of the field.

39:49.762 --> 39:52.390
And if you ever need
confidence in your car,

39:52.473 --> 39:53.766
it's here at Silverstone.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.701
Hayes is just sailing
past people.

40:12.785 --> 40:15.955
He's moved up seven places
since the start.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.833
-Apex GP has struggled with this car...
-Yes!

40:18.916 --> 40:21.335
...but they've brought an
upgrade package this weekend.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.797
Let's see if it makes a difference as
Hayes attacks Perez in the Red Bull.

40:29.218 --> 40:32.721
Car's bouncing around this dirty air.
I can't position to attack.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.015
Hayes complaining
about his car over the radio.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.852
That's not what the team
wants to hear.

40:37.935 --> 40:41.147
Copy. Gap is 0.9 to Perez.
You're within DRS range.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.190
Should be able to take him
on the next straight.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.488
Hayes now using the drag
reduction system to get past.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.115
Yeah!

40:51.198 --> 40:53.409
Won't be able to hold him off, guys.
I got no grip.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.536
-This is trouble now for Apex GP.
-Oh, come on.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.580
The Red Bull's tires
are now warm

40:57.663 --> 41:00.875
and Hayes hasn't got his tire
advantage from the start anymore.

41:00.958 --> 41:04.420
We've seen the attack.
Now it's all about defense.

41:04.503 --> 41:07.173
And Perez on the attack
into Vale.

41:07.256 --> 41:10.634
Hayes is in trouble.
This could be the places reversed.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.470
And it is.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.846
Damn.

41:13.929 --> 41:15.973
Rear end is loose.
Tell me if you see a fix.

41:16.056 --> 41:18.559
Tell him to pull back the entry
to get a better exit.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.644
He-He thinks it's the setup.
It's not.

41:23.397 --> 41:24.648
Twenty laps down.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.192
Verstappen leads
but Joshua Pearce

41:26.275 --> 41:28.569
is struggling
out there at the moment.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.238
Guys, get me off these softs.
I'm going backwards.

41:31.322 --> 41:34.325
Copy that. Lap 20. Box, box.

41:34.408 --> 41:36.911
Stakes couldn't be
higher for rookie Joshua Pearce.

41:36.994 --> 41:40.289
This is not where you want to
be, in last place.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.293
I'm jammed. Back up!

41:51.425 --> 41:52.927
Hit something. What was that?

41:54.345 --> 41:56.680
Ooh,
a seven-second pit stop.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.849
Apex GP won't be happy
with that.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.602
That's double the time
it should've taken.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.395
Lost the rears. Box, box.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.397
Copy. Go to plan B. Box, box.

42:05.481 --> 42:08.901
And here comes Sonny
Hayes for a fresh set of tires.

42:08.984 --> 42:13.697
He'll be hoping these will help him
hold on to his current position of P15.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.367
-Front jacks! Front jacks!
-The front jack has not worked properly.

42:16.450 --> 42:19.537
-You're kidding me.
-This is causing absolute pandemonium

42:19.620 --> 42:21.705
in the Apex GP pit lane.

42:23.999 --> 42:26.961
Whatever could go wrong
is going wrong for this team.

42:30.464 --> 42:34.218
And coming out of the pit,
Hayes just ahead of his teammate.

42:34.301 --> 42:38.389
As Pearce and Hayes go battling
it out here at Silverstone.

42:38.472 --> 42:39.765
Coming for you, old man.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.024
Got the pace, man.
Tell him to let me pass.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.693
Yeah. Copy. Hold position.
Stand by. Kate.

42:50.776 --> 42:53.487
Josh is faster.
Sonny is on cold tires.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.661
Yeah, okay, Sonny, no fighting.
Let him through.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.502
Sonny, no fighting.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.170
Who's fighting? I'm racing.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.506
Pearce on the inside,
Hayes on the outside.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.758
Hayes trying
to make him eat concrete

43:14.842 --> 43:16.719
up against the old
pit wall there.

43:16.802 --> 43:18.762
Joshua, you're gonna
have to fight for position.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.098
-You are racing Sonny.
-A-ffirm.

43:21.181 --> 43:23.601
They're giving
absolutely no quarter.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.853
No benefit
to their teammate at all.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.522
They're pushing as if they're
trying to win a Grand Prix.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.650
But this is the battle
for last place, remember?

43:31.734 --> 43:32.943
And what a brawl it is.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.320
Let's go, kid. Bring it.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.700
What is this guy doing?
Let me through.

43:56.216 --> 43:58.052
Round the final corner.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.303
It's close!

43:59.386 --> 44:01.055
They make contact.

44:01.138 --> 44:04.516
Both Apex GP cars into the gravel,

44:04.600 --> 44:06.352
and Pearce hits the barrier.

44:08.479 --> 44:09.813
-Ah, no!
-No!

44:10.689 --> 44:11.940
This is mad.

44:12.024 --> 44:14.068
The cardinal sin
of motor racing.

44:14.151 --> 44:16.070
A double DNF.

44:16.153 --> 44:19.907
Just when it couldn't get any
worse for the black and gold.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.325
That's a tough one, man.

44:37.758 --> 44:39.426
We can't corner.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.970
We're bouncing around the place
like we're on the bloody Tube

44:42.054 --> 44:43.806
and now we think it's cool to
leave wheel guns in the pit box.

44:44.598 --> 44:45.599
Who even was that?

44:45.683 --> 44:47.893
-That was me.
-Of course.

44:50.437 --> 44:51.438
Old man.

44:54.650 --> 44:56.985
You losing your hearing?
What was that?

44:57.903 --> 44:59.446
You wanna do this here?

44:59.530 --> 45:01.699
Yeah, I'd love to do this here
in front of the team, right.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.242
The one that
you're apparently a part of.

45:03.325 --> 45:05.786
Okay. You made a mistake. It happens.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.705
I made a mistake.
I love this guy, man.

45:07.788 --> 45:10.040
-Don't worry about it, Jodie.
-Are you even listening to me?

45:10.124 --> 45:12.000
-Not really.
-No!

45:12.084 --> 45:13.293
Stop.

45:13.377 --> 45:14.878
Joshua is right.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.714
An order is an order.

45:16.797 --> 45:19.383
May I remind you
that you report to me?

45:23.220 --> 45:23.971
Cool.

45:25.222 --> 45:26.849
Just don't ask me
to give up position.

45:29.893 --> 45:31.812
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

45:33.939 --> 45:35.733
Hold up.

45:35.816 --> 45:37.317
You swan into our garage
like some entitled prick.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.445
-"Swan"?
-Calling us piss poor...

45:39.528 --> 45:40.821
-What's "swan"?
-...and then you drive like that. Huh?

45:40.904 --> 45:43.031
You said I "swan."
What's that mean?

45:43.115 --> 45:45.492
You. You're an arsehole.
You come in like an arsehole. You swan.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.161
So swans are assholes?

45:49.747 --> 45:52.207
You're making the mistake of thinking
that I'm just gonna be some grateful kid

45:52.291 --> 45:54.710
who'll bend a knee
to an old-timer.

45:54.793 --> 45:56.837
I climbed a mountain
to get here, bro.

45:57.546 --> 45:58.922
Formula 1.

45:59.006 --> 46:01.717
Back home we call that
a participation trophy.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.469
Joshua, Joshua! Josh!

46:04.720 --> 46:06.597
Yeah.

46:08.015 --> 46:10.476
What the hell
are you smiling about, man?

46:10.559 --> 46:12.102
Did you win something?

46:12.186 --> 46:14.521
There's 20 other drivers
still out on that track

46:14.605 --> 46:16.648
and you're in here
posing for that nonsense.

46:16.732 --> 46:19.359
Do you think any of them
respect us? Do you?

46:21.403 --> 46:23.947
They need to learn that no one
gets past us without a fight.

46:24.031 --> 46:24.782
No one.

46:28.285 --> 46:30.746
You don't like the way
I'm driving? Beat me, swan.

46:38.170 --> 46:38.921
Hell of a race, huh?

46:39.588 --> 46:40.756
Whoo!

46:59.233 --> 47:03.111
Sorry, I didn't see you.
Um...

47:03.195 --> 47:05.239
You still
beating yourself up?

47:05.322 --> 47:06.573
Yeah.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.534
Yeah, I know that one.

47:10.953 --> 47:13.789
Um, thanks for
what you said out there.

47:15.415 --> 47:18.919
Just don't do it again, okay?

47:19.002 --> 47:20.212
Makes me look
like I need help.

47:21.463 --> 47:24.174
Oh, man. You're right.
Got it.

47:24.258 --> 47:27.761
Hey, for what it's worth,
don't be shitty to yourself.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.596
There's plenty of people out
there that'll do that for you.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.014
Yeah.

47:39.857 --> 47:44.152
"I'm sorry, Ruben, for demolishing
not one but both of your lovely cars.

47:44.236 --> 47:46.822
For coming back into your life
only to destroy it."

47:46.905 --> 47:48.115
Is this your revenge
for Monaco?

47:48.198 --> 47:49.950
Yeah, I waited 30 years

47:50.033 --> 47:53.245
and came all this way to humiliate
myself on global television.

47:53.328 --> 47:56.540
Funny. You think I brought you
in to make my other driver quit?

47:56.623 --> 48:00.502
Listen, he's cocky. He's arrogant.
He's got a lot to learn.

48:04.506 --> 48:07.301
You were cocky, you were arrogant
and you had a lot to learn.

48:07.384 --> 48:10.137
I'm not here to hold anyone's hand.
I'm here to race.

48:10.220 --> 48:12.848
No, you're not, Sonny.
You're here to give me a heart attack.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.684
The board is up my ass

48:17.394 --> 48:19.730
and I have to decide
whether to continue this fiasco

48:19.813 --> 48:22.441
-or pull the plug now.
-You have till the end of the season.

48:22.524 --> 48:24.985
By which time Apex will be
worth less than my shoes!

48:25.861 --> 48:27.571
Sonny! God...

48:30.449 --> 48:31.241
Tell me about Kate.

48:33.118 --> 48:34.745
The car.
I wanna talk to her about the car.

48:34.828 --> 48:37.205
She's the world's first female
tech director of an F1 team.

48:37.289 --> 48:38.624
I mean, that takes balls.

48:38.707 --> 48:41.376
Wow. Is that your line?

48:41.460 --> 48:42.586
She'll see right through it.

48:42.669 --> 48:43.837
It's not a line.

48:43.921 --> 48:46.298
-I'm sorry. Sorry.
-Is she married?

48:46.381 --> 48:49.801
Okay, stay there in that tub
of ice until Budapest.

48:49.885 --> 48:51.219
You don't move.

48:53.680 --> 48:54.890
Hey, Ruben...

48:57.017 --> 48:58.352
We can't get there
with this car.

49:44.898 --> 49:46.817
Hey. Hey.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.151
Yeah, sorry. Hi, hi, hi.

49:48.902 --> 49:50.487
What you working on?

49:50.570 --> 49:52.990
I'm working on a
new front wing concept.

49:53.073 --> 49:55.242
Trying to pick us
up a tenth or so.

49:55.325 --> 49:58.662
Cool. And you can replicate turns?
Lateral airflow?

49:58.745 --> 50:00.497
No, just straight line drag.

50:00.580 --> 50:02.708
But, I mean,
we can calculate it from there.

50:02.791 --> 50:06.712
Okay, what about turbulent air
from a car we're following?

50:06.795 --> 50:08.714
No, not exactly, but--

50:08.797 --> 50:11.800
Track conditions, surface
quality, weather, ambient temps?

50:11.883 --> 50:15.679
I'm sorry, uh, is there
something that you wanted to discuss?

50:15.762 --> 50:18.265
Kate, you read my mind.

50:22.769 --> 50:26.314
So how does one get to be the first
female technical director of an F1 team?

50:26.398 --> 50:27.357
Must take...

50:31.028 --> 50:34.031
dedication
and lots of hard work.

50:34.114 --> 50:37.617
-That's your urgent question?
-Hmm? Mm-mmm.

50:37.701 --> 50:41.371
Plenty of people think I don't belong
here and I'm happy to add you to the list

50:41.455 --> 50:43.206
if you're implying what I...
I think you're implying.

50:43.290 --> 50:44.708
As a rule I don't imply stuff.

50:44.791 --> 50:46.084
So you like straight talk?

50:46.168 --> 50:47.836
Straight as an arrow. No sugar.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.881
Everyone thinks
Ruben's lost it.

50:50.964 --> 50:52.049
That he is clutching at straws.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.051
They're saying
maybe he lost a bet.

50:54.134 --> 50:56.386
Ran over your dog.

50:56.470 --> 51:01.516
They're saying Sonny Hayes
isn't a has-been.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.559
He's a never-was.

51:06.521 --> 51:09.649
Yeah, when I said I like
straight talk I meant me.

51:09.733 --> 51:12.903
From others, I mostly prefer
praise, flattery, hero worship,

51:12.986 --> 51:14.738
at times, straight-up bullshit.

51:14.821 --> 51:17.324
Is that what Ruben's for?

51:17.407 --> 51:19.618
Ruben. I love the guy.
Most solid, steadfast--

51:19.701 --> 51:21.203
Said you asked
if I was married.

51:21.286 --> 51:24.790
Disloyal, mean, twisted,
bitter, husk of a man.

51:24.873 --> 51:31.004
Mmm, yeah. And he also told me about a
big string of ex-wives and girlfriends.

51:31.088 --> 51:32.589
He said to avoid you
like the plague.

51:32.672 --> 51:35.634
Okay...
...let me explain this.

51:37.177 --> 51:39.346
When you're going 200 miles
per hour into Eau Rouge,

51:39.429 --> 51:41.389
it's good to know
who's got your back.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.684
And for the record,
in all my years of racing,

51:44.768 --> 51:49.272
I have never ever hit on
the team technical director.

51:49.356 --> 51:53.110
Well, now that's
a huge weight off my mind.

51:57.197 --> 51:59.449
So what's this urgent question?

51:59.533 --> 52:00.283
Okay.

52:01.743 --> 52:05.205
Red Bull, Ferrari,
Mercedes, Aston, now McLaren

52:05.288 --> 52:06.706
all have us beat
on straight line speed.

52:06.790 --> 52:09.417
Our shot is battling
in the turns.

52:09.501 --> 52:11.878
I need a way
to chase through the dirty air.

52:14.714 --> 52:18.635
You want me to redesign
so you can follow closer?

52:18.718 --> 52:20.095
We need to build our car
for combat.

52:21.471 --> 52:23.598
Uh, how am I supposed to
make that safe?

52:23.682 --> 52:24.975
Who said anything about safe?

52:27.644 --> 52:28.812
That's your question?

52:28.895 --> 52:30.188
Yeah.

52:30.272 --> 52:31.273
And here's the straight talk.

52:32.732 --> 52:33.483
It's urgent.

52:39.531 --> 52:42.284
You know, I bet when
you look in the mirror,

52:42.367 --> 52:48.707
you see this rough-and-tumble,
old school, no bullshit cowboy.

52:48.790 --> 52:51.668
Doesn't take orders.
Goes his own way. Huh?

52:51.751 --> 52:53.295
A lone wolf.

52:54.296 --> 52:55.922
Well, I have news for you.

52:56.006 --> 52:58.925
Formula 1 is a team sport.
It always was.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.553
And maybe that's why
you failed at it?

53:02.971 --> 53:04.306
The only question here is,

53:04.389 --> 53:06.766
"Why did Sonny Hayes
come back to F1?"

53:06.850 --> 53:11.354
Now that question
is extremely fucking urgent.

53:15.609 --> 53:18.904
I'll start listening to you
when you finish a race.

54:40.277 --> 54:43.571
At the Spanish Grand Prix,
the American rookie Sonny Hayes

54:43.655 --> 54:47.575
had just signed a new contract,
and his future looked very bright.

54:47.659 --> 54:51.288
He'd earned a reputation for
his aggressive driving style.

54:51.371 --> 54:55.250
Seen by some as reckless,
it nevertheless served him well

54:55.333 --> 54:58.044
as he climbed up the order
over the course of the season,

54:58.128 --> 55:00.880
relentlessly pursuing
his first F1 victory.

55:02.799 --> 55:05.552
Hayes was running well
in the opening laps,

55:05.635 --> 55:08.430
chasing down race leader
Ayrton Senna.

55:08.513 --> 55:10.724
However when Hayes
made a risky move

55:10.807 --> 55:15.270
and attacked Senna on the outside
of a high-speed right-hand turn,

55:15.353 --> 55:18.857
a frightening scene unfolded
as quick as a flash.

55:18.940 --> 55:21.401
My goodness!
I just saw him plunge off to the right.

55:21.484 --> 55:22.902
There you can see
the debris on the right.

55:22.986 --> 55:25.572
What on earth happened there,
I don't know.

55:25.655 --> 55:27.574
Yes,
this looks very severe indeed.

55:27.657 --> 55:30.660
I must say, it looks like, uh, he is...
he really needs help.

55:30.744 --> 55:32.579
There is nobody coming to him
at the moment.

55:32.662 --> 55:34.664
The race has been stopped.
The red flag is out.

55:34.748 --> 55:36.541
This looks a little bit
like a--

55:54.142 --> 55:57.645
Our models predict all teams
are gonna be targeting a one-stop race.

55:57.729 --> 56:01.816
Plan A is to switch from mediums to
hards, between lap 27 and 33.

56:01.900 --> 56:04.277
Plan B will be
medium-hard-medium,

56:04.361 --> 56:08.198
first window 16 to 21,
second, 45 to 51.

56:08.281 --> 56:09.908
Plan C for softs
doesn't make sense.

56:09.991 --> 56:12.035
At this temp,
the tire deg will be too high.

56:13.953 --> 56:15.372
Nothing else?

56:15.455 --> 56:17.499
-Yep.
-Yeah, Joshua?

56:17.582 --> 56:19.501
So, we've just got to
drive our race, all right?

56:19.584 --> 56:20.835
Let's not try and be heroes.

56:20.919 --> 56:22.837
Just make it through
those first turns clean.

56:22.921 --> 56:25.090
Can't win at lap one,
starting at the back,

56:25.173 --> 56:28.385
so we just gotta hope for some
lucky breaks later on, all right?

56:28.468 --> 56:29.469
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

56:29.552 --> 56:31.054
Create your own breaks.

56:32.472 --> 56:34.349
Um, hello, hi?
I just said that.

56:35.725 --> 56:36.810
Hope is not a strategy.

56:40.897 --> 56:42.148
Anything else, Professor?

56:43.066 --> 56:44.984
Um...

56:45.610 --> 56:46.486
Drive fast?

57:04.796 --> 57:06.756
It's lights out,
and away we go.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.426
Great start from Hamilton,
Verstappen battling with him.

57:09.509 --> 57:12.512
Piastri, Zhou, Leclerc...
and here come the two Apex GPs.

57:13.805 --> 57:15.682
But Gasly shuts the door,

57:15.765 --> 57:17.434
leaving them with
nowhere to go.

57:24.691 --> 57:27.944
Into turn one,
and there's three cars gone off.

57:28.027 --> 57:31.197
Gasly, Ocon,
and the AlphaTauri, Tsunoda.

57:31.281 --> 57:32.824
Hit debris.
Check my tires.

57:32.907 --> 57:35.410
Yeah, you've got a puncture.
Right rear. Box. Box this lap.

57:35.493 --> 57:38.455
First goddamn turn.
A ruined race.

57:38.538 --> 57:40.748
Oh, shit, shit,
shit. Ah, shit.

57:44.377 --> 57:46.379
He's coming in! Let's go.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.131
Let's go Plan C.

57:48.214 --> 57:50.425
No, Plan C is for soft tires.

57:50.508 --> 57:52.469
They won't last ten laps
in this heat. No.

57:52.552 --> 57:53.761
That's a negative, Sonny.
Plan A.

57:53.845 --> 57:55.305
Plan A is called Plan A

57:55.388 --> 57:56.306
'cause it's when everything
is going right.

57:56.389 --> 57:57.390
You see anything going right?

57:58.016 --> 57:59.893
Plan C. Softs.

57:59.976 --> 58:02.645
It's not his call.
Tell him A, as in "asshole."

58:04.022 --> 58:05.398
Okay, let's go!
Turn 'em out! Hard tires.

58:05.482 --> 58:06.858
Softs, goddamn it.

58:12.572 --> 58:15.575
-What's wrong with the car?
-The guy sitting in it.

58:15.658 --> 58:17.619
Are you insane?
We need hard tires.

58:17.702 --> 58:20.330
Everybody here
is at a one-stop race.

58:20.413 --> 58:22.248
We do what
everybody does, we lose.

58:24.125 --> 58:26.419
-Make him go!
-How?

58:26.503 --> 58:29.506
You think I don't know
my tires? I was a mechanic.

58:29.589 --> 58:33.009
Five championship titles
with my bare freaking hands!

58:36.304 --> 58:37.055
Give him his tires.

58:38.932 --> 58:40.225
-Okay, let's go.
-Go, go, change!

58:40.308 --> 58:41.601
Let's go, let's go!
Change quick, now!

58:47.273 --> 58:48.024
Be ready.

58:48.107 --> 58:49.651
Ready for what?

58:57.283 --> 59:00.119
-Where's JP sitting?
-Currently running P14.

59:02.747 --> 59:04.624
All right,
here we go now.

59:04.707 --> 59:06.084
Hayes makes his move,

59:06.167 --> 59:08.670
chasing Kevin Magnussen.
It's a late lunge!

59:08.753 --> 59:10.922
He's damaged
his front wing.

59:11.005 --> 59:15.134
Any driver knows Magnussen will shut
the door on a clumsy move like that.

59:15.218 --> 59:16.970
Aw, dagnabbit.

59:17.053 --> 59:18.304
Plan C for "chaos."

59:19.889 --> 59:21.599
So that will
bring out a safety car,

59:21.683 --> 59:23.059
which always shakes up a race.

59:23.142 --> 59:24.435
Slows down the leaders,

59:24.519 --> 59:26.229
leaves the field
bunched up together,

59:26.312 --> 59:28.731
and gives teams the chance
for a quick pit stop,

59:28.815 --> 59:31.025
which only costs
half the usual time.

59:31.109 --> 59:32.443
Safety car.
We're boxing, right?

59:32.527 --> 59:33.861
Standby. Kate,

59:33.945 --> 59:35.029
shouldn't we take advantage

59:35.113 --> 59:36.573
while the safety car window
is open?

59:36.656 --> 59:38.658
It's early. We gain track
position if we stay out.

59:38.741 --> 59:42.245
Stay out, stay out.
Want you out. Push, push, Joshua.

59:42.328 --> 59:44.163
So,
the midfield moves up for the moment,

59:44.247 --> 59:47.166
including Joshua Pearce
to P12.

59:47.250 --> 59:49.335
This guy better not
be messing up my race.

59:54.966 --> 59:56.009
Where's JP now?

59:56.092 --> 59:57.385
Currently running P12.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.977
Okay. Plan C. Be ready.

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:08.438
He's gonna do it again.

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:14.736
Back marker Hayes
is now down a lap.

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:18.281
He has to let Bottas pass,
or face a five-second penalty.

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:20.950
Hayes is making it
very difficult for Bottas.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:24.037
Under the rules he has to let him
through before passing three blue flags,

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.955
or risk a penalty.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.625
Hey, I'm just putting it out there,
but, uh, maybe you should drive.

01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:33.004
Sonny, you've gotten the blue flag.
Let Bottas through.

01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:35.632
Come on, now.
Little closer.

01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:39.594
Sonny, do you copy?

01:00:39.677 --> 01:00:41.054
I hear ya.
Lettin' him through.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:44.140
Whoops, my bad.

01:00:44.223 --> 01:00:46.059
And that's
his front wing again!

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:48.978
Oh, that's gonna bring out
another safety car.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:52.315
Given that each wing
costs more than £200,000,

01:00:52.398 --> 01:00:54.776
I think the team might want
Sonny to start chipping in there.

01:01:00.281 --> 01:01:02.367
Guys, it's another free stop.
Please tell me we're boxing.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.077
Uh, we're checking.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.579
-Keep him out.
-Stay out. Stay out. You are staying out.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.998
More drivers come in
to take fresh tires,

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:12.919
but still, Joshua Pearce remains on track.
He's moved up to P11.

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:17.215
Look who's back.

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:22.804
I know, I know. Be ready.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.517
What is he doing?

01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:30.645
I think he's trying
to score us a point.

01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:35.274
Tell JP
to save his tires.

01:01:36.734 --> 01:01:39.362
Joshua, just take care of
your tires, okay?

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:41.114
You have to make them last.

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:43.908
Last?
No shit. I will be.

01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:49.831
With four laps to go
in this stop-and-go race,

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:51.791
thanks to Sonny Hayes,

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.960
the driver helped most is his
teammate, now in tenth.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:56.921
With a 12-second gap
ahead of Stroll.

01:01:58.256 --> 01:01:59.298
Tell JP to maintain that gap.

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.300
Keep pushing.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.554
My tires are gone, man.
What are you waiting for?

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:06.389
Copy that. We have to call it.

01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:07.807
He's losing over a second
every lap.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:09.892
Stand by.

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:11.436
Into turn two.
Hayes battles

01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:13.688
with the Williams
and pushes it wide.

01:02:13.771 --> 01:02:15.398
Seriously,
what are we waiting for?

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:20.153
Sonny's off the track.

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:22.905
He's gone too far over.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.490
And that's gonna cause damage.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:26.909
Plan C.

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:29.620
Oopsie. Sorry, guys.

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:33.624
That's the third safety
car involving the Apex GP driver,

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:37.170
bringing the Hungarian Grand
Prix to an absolute crawl.

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:39.464
A sub three-second stop,
and he'll keep P10.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:40.757
Box, Joshua. Box, box, box.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.258
Copy. Coming in.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.304
What did you say?

01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:48.723
Joshua Pearce
finally gets to pit.

01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:52.143
And with a quick stop
here, he could stay in the top ten.

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:03.696
This is critical.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.700
Pearce must beat Stroll to the pit
exit line to maintain tenth place.

01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:10.495
And he's done it!

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.038
With yellow flags out,

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.540
all the cars are forced
to hold track position,

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.793
-meaning that thanks to Sonny Hayes...
-Let's go!

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.920
-...the race ends under a safety car.
-Yeah!

01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:20.797
-Vegas!
-What? Whoa!

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:23.883
Hey, yeah. Fuck you.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.429
Yeah!

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:29.931
Yes, baby!

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:42.777
You're crazy, bro.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.071
It's just tenth.
What are you smiling about?

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.534
And behind
our podium placings,

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:52.119
Hamilton and Piastri
complete the top five,

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:54.205
-and Joshua Pearce in tenth...
-Wow.

01:03:54.288 --> 01:03:56.582
-...scoring Expensify Apex GP...
-Yeah, baby.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.167
...their first ever point.

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:03.548
Did you see me? Crazy, right?

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:06.175
-A deal's a deal. I finished.
-Yeah, in last place.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:07.969
Sounds great when you say it.

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:16.394
I know you have
to go see the stewards later,

01:04:16.477 --> 01:04:18.229
what do you think they're
gonna make of your race today?

01:04:18.312 --> 01:04:20.439
Well, I have to admit,
you guys got this one right.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.568
-I'm, like... Thank you. Thank you.
-Good job. Yeah.

01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:26.737
I'm still a bit rusty and, you
know, finding my way with this car,

01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:28.656
but I'm confident
we'll get there.

01:04:28.739 --> 01:04:32.034
A rope-a-dope at Silverstone,
a demolition derby here in Hungary...

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:33.536
You've been banned
from casinos.

01:04:33.619 --> 01:04:34.829
Are you trying
to get banned from F1?

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:36.289
Take the whole team
down with you?

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.332
Tell you what, Don,
what do you say we make a bet?

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.626
Your £10 against my 10 grand.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.546
We place at Monza, I win your 10.
We don't, you win mine.

01:04:43.629 --> 01:04:45.131
Let's do this, man.

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:46.299
Put your money
where your mouth is.

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:49.760
What the hell? I'll take that.

01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:51.554
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

01:04:51.637 --> 01:04:54.390
Hey. No more press.

01:04:54.473 --> 01:04:56.434
No, Sonny, you don't wanna
make the media your enemy.

01:04:56.517 --> 01:04:57.852
And you'll be fined.

01:04:57.935 --> 01:04:59.478
Take it out of my paycheck.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:00.813
We don't pay you enough.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.274
You know, I have to say.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:05.985
I kinda like it.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:10.615
It's very sort of punk rock
for the brand.

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:14.702
Hmm.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:24.754
Let's run it again.

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:35.431
How long's he been in there?

01:05:35.514 --> 01:05:38.726
All day. Playing with different
tire pressures, ride heights.

01:05:40.144 --> 01:05:41.771
What were his times?

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:42.939
He found half a second.

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:49.904
Give me the same setup as him.

01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:13.469
It must be late.
I'm seeing double.

01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:18.057
A deal's a deal.
I'm building her for combat.

01:06:19.725 --> 01:06:20.851
At the Dutch Grand Prix,

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.561
you'll be entering
the Tarzan Corner

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.147
at 322 kilometers per hour.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:27.483
Yeah. Too late
to change my mind?

01:06:27.566 --> 01:06:29.110
Yeah.

01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:37.410
To answer your question,

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:41.080
I was in aerospace at Lockheed
when Ruben came in and...

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.417
He liked my work,
liked my attitude,

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.170
and he sold me on the thrill of fighting
to the death for a tenth of a second.

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:53.509
Traveling the world,
the roar of a crowd...

01:06:53.592 --> 01:06:56.387
So, I ran the idea
past my husband.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.851
Who swiftly became
my ex-husband.

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:05.146
Good night.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.106
Good night.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:33.841
Do you know
what time it is?

01:07:34.633 --> 01:07:36.052
All right.

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.470
Tell me about the kid.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.395
Okay, here's another one
my dad would say.

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:48.189
"Slow is smooth,
smooth is fast."

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:52.026
For what it's worth.
One more time around?

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:55.237
Just one? Come on. Is that all?

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:56.739
I'd never live with myself,

01:07:56.822 --> 01:07:59.116
if I can't keep up
with you, Mr. 1990s.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.452
Let's go!

01:08:01.535 --> 01:08:03.746
Joining us today,
we have Kaspar Smolinski,

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:05.998
Zak Brown and Fred Vasseur.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.627
Now, Kaspar, can we start with you,
after what was a fantastic result

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:11.921
-for the team in Hungary last time out...
-Thank you.

01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:17.009
...but Sonny has got you skirting
the line of penalties and violations.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.637
Is this your only strategy,

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.389
and have you got any spare
parts left in the factory?

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:25.434
We compete like everybody else.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:26.727
Race models change.

01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:29.188
We must adapt, huh?

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:31.273
Well, Zak, can we bring you
in on this?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:35.111
Because you've faced Hayes before,
you know the gray areas in which he works.

01:08:36.695 --> 01:08:39.949
Certainly do. Uh, first of all,
he's a lot grayer now.

01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:42.034
And, uh, we keep tabs on him,

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.244
you know, back there behind us.

01:08:43.327 --> 01:08:44.954
And Fred,

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:46.455
any concerns from Ferrari?

01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:49.250
What does Ferrari
think of Apex?

01:08:49.333 --> 01:08:52.419
We don't.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:11.313
Sonny! You're the best!

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:16.152
A better qualifying yesterday
gets us in the thick of things.

01:09:16.235 --> 01:09:18.821
P10, P15.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.823
So we're gonna go
for a two stop.

01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:25.411
Medium-hard-medium, that's plan A.
Final stint, we go hards for plan B.

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:27.872
So, on this,
do you have any track concerns?

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.707
Don't look at me. Look at him.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:32.585
It's good for JP.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:34.170
Start me on hards.

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:37.923
Nah, the track's cooled down.
You won't have any grip.

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:40.134
That's right.

01:09:40.217 --> 01:09:42.928
For three weeks,
all the talk's been how reckless I am.

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:46.140
Everyone's wondering if I'm
gonna drive 'em off track,

01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:48.309
which means no one's
gonna be watching out for him.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:54.148
Today, you win us this race.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.950
Twenty laps down here at
Monza, and the pack have been split.

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:07.703
The leaders are pulling away,
led by Max Verstappen,

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:10.372
with Joshua Pearce
back in P10.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.125
Meanwhile, Sonny Hayes
is holding up the rest of the pack,

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.627
stuck behind him
in a DRS train.

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.380
Pearce looks to be
in a great position

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:20.174
to finish in the top ten,

01:10:20.257 --> 01:10:22.927
and maybe even a run
to the podium.

01:10:25.262 --> 01:10:27.514
But there's still a
long way to go in this race,

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:31.310
and with rain potentially
forecast, anything can happen.

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:33.270
Tires are gone. Coming in.

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:34.772
Yeah, copy. Box. Box.

01:10:34.855 --> 01:10:36.523
Apex GP is prepping

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:37.900
a fresh set of tires
for Hayes.

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:39.193
That's gonna bring in

01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:41.695
all the other teams
to avoid the undercut.

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:43.530
Uh, changed my mind.

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:45.157
But, no!
He's staying out,

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.409
with the cars behind him
all scrambling

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:51.747
to get on fresh tires that apparently
he doesn't think he needs anymore.

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:54.208
Should we just do the opposite
of what he tells us to do?

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:56.001
Stand by till I lose my tires.

01:10:57.294 --> 01:10:58.504
I thought he had
lost his tires.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.172
I think
he means literally.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.386
Puncture, left rear. Coming in.

01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:07.429
And there goes
Hayes's tires.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:10.057
That's quite a mess,
gravel on the track.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:13.394
That will bring out the virtual
safety car for a quick sweep.

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:14.853
So the race
gets neutralized.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:18.565
Everyone slows down
to 40% of their racing speed,

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:20.943
and all the race strategies
will get a reset.

01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:23.821
And that is why this is
the perfect time to take a pit stop.

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:25.614
While you're in the pit lane,

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:28.575
your opponents are restricted
to a much slower pace

01:11:28.659 --> 01:11:31.287
and you're not going to lose as
much track position when you rejoin.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:32.788
I take it
I'm staying out, right?

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:34.707
Copy. Joshua, stay out.
Stay out.

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:37.167
-We want you out to gain track position.
-Copy.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:39.253
Up is down, down is up.

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:49.805
Sonny Hayes hesitated
before he left his pit box,

01:11:49.888 --> 01:11:52.433
and he's come out just in
front of Max Verstappen.

01:11:52.516 --> 01:11:54.018
That was naughty.

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:56.228
Hayes has slowed
a bit in the pit lane,

01:11:56.312 --> 01:12:00.024
which will cost the Red Bull and
the two Ferraris precious time.

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:01.400
Push, Joshua. Push.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.277
You are now P4. P4.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.406
Who's coming up from behind?
Here he is, Joshua Pearce.

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.491
-Let's see! Let's go!
-Yes!

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:11.160
-This is all playing into his hands...
-Wow.

01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:13.704
...at the moment.
Could be a dream afternoon.

01:12:13.787 --> 01:12:16.665
But can Hayes hold Verstappen
for a little bit longer?

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:19.835
Verstappen tries into turn
one, nothing doing there.

01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:22.671
Gets the better exit.
Through the Curva Grande we go.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:25.090
-Damn, he's good.
-Verstappen's trying to get past.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.884
Sonny Hayes looking
carefully in his mirrors.

01:12:26.967 --> 01:12:29.053
He must let
Max Verstappen through.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.929
Yeah, I deserved that.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.432
And Max shows
his disapproval,

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:37.102
and I don't blame him, as they head
down towards the second chicane.

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.772
And through goes
Joshua Pearce in P4,

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:42.399
now much closer
to the front of the pack.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:48.530
Just seven laps to
go, and here comes the rain.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.533
Let's see who plays it safe
with a switch to the intermediate tire,

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.786
and who might gamble
to stay out on slicks.

01:13:00.584 --> 01:13:02.503
It's getting tricky out here, guys.
What's the plan?

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:06.340
You're running P4. We think P2 and P3
are switching to inters for safety,

01:13:06.423 --> 01:13:08.092
and it looks like P1
is staying out.

01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:09.676
-What do you wanna do?
-What's Sonny gonna do?

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.262
Take a wild guess.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:13.389
-I'm staying out.
-Copy that.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:18.352
And the two Ferraris
come in for intermediate tires.

01:13:18.435 --> 01:13:20.938
Let's see who else
decides to play it safe.

01:13:21.021 --> 01:13:24.650
And as George Russell
pits, Joshua Pearce moves into P2.

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.946
Sonny, Joshua is staying out on slicks.
If he can hold on and find a dry line,

01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:30.155
he's gonna finish second.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.073
Second's not enough.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.284
Damn it.

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:35.994
Okay, coming in for inters.

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:38.622
-Inters, inters.
-Let's go! He's coming in!

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:48.090
-How far behind me are they?
-Thirty seconds.

01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:50.008
Oh, my God.
He's gonna take out Verstappen.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.094
Let me know when
they hit the main straight.

01:13:52.177 --> 01:13:55.180
Don't tell him! They penalize both cars.
They will take the win away.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:56.265
Just trust me, will ya?

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:01.186
I'm pushing
but I can't catch him.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.272
As the race leaders
approach the main straight,

01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:06.275
Sonny Hayes is in another
standoff over team strategy.

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:07.734
-Now.
-No!

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.864
Finally,
Hayes back out onto the track,

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:13.866
and just in front
of Verstappen.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:17.035
Now he'll get a blue flag here
so Verstappen can get past,

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:21.415
but until then, the Dutch driver
is caught up in Hayes's dirty air.

01:14:21.498 --> 01:14:23.417
With every turn
he hangs on,

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.919
he slows Verstappen
a fraction of a second,

01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:29.548
providing Joshua Pearce
one last chance to catch up.

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:30.632
I can see him.
I'm almost there.

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:33.802
Tell JP to follow me.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:37.639
-Copy. Uh, Joshua, Sonny is your tow.
-I'm right behind him.

01:14:38.932 --> 01:14:40.642
Verstappen
pulls away then.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.228
But now, onto the rear wing
of his teammate's car

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.022
comes Joshua Pearce.

01:14:45.105 --> 01:14:47.399
Pearce picks up
the slipstream from Hayes,

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:50.319
gaining time,
but driving blind in the spray.

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:55.073
Come on. Stay with me.
Stay with me now.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.040
Pass. Pass.

01:15:03.123 --> 01:15:04.500
-Overtake him. Overtake.
-Copy.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.793
He's been gaining, and boom!

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:09.505
Joshua Pearce
slingshots past Sonny Hayes,

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:12.758
and now is in striking distance of P1.

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:14.927
Tell JP to wait for the
straight into turn one.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.762
Be patient.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:19.014
-Straight at turn one.
-Copy.

01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:22.893
Joshua, Sonny says wait for the straight.
The straight into turn one.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.271
I'm right there.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.649
I've got him.

01:15:28.732 --> 01:15:31.026
Pearce is right on
the gearbox of Verstappen,

01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:33.946
down the back straight
at over 200 miles an hour.

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.531
I see an opening. Going for it.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.908
The rookie attacks in 11.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.535
No, no!

01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:42.788
Pearce pulls
alongside the Red Bull,

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:45.541
he's wheels ahead,
for the first time ever...

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:48.544
Apex GP... Oh, no!

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:49.836
No!

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:27.851
For God's sake.

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.780
Bernadette, how's he doing?

01:17:39.863 --> 01:17:41.198
He's stable.

01:17:41.281 --> 01:17:42.866
He's resting now.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.080
Very happy to hear it.

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.582
I'm so sorry for what happened.
It was clearly--

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.626
Sonny, over here, please.

01:18:07.265 --> 01:18:10.102
Um, I just wanna say
I've been--

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:11.645
Joshua says you're an asshole.

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:15.816
Yeah, that tracks.

01:18:15.899 --> 01:18:18.110
I think you're
a dangerous asshole.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.864
-Ms. Pearce--
-You're part of the same team, right?

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:24.241
Looking out for each other.

01:18:24.324 --> 01:18:26.993
Except you had him
doing something so dangerous

01:18:27.077 --> 01:18:29.037
it almost got him killed.

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:33.667
-Okay, listen--
-No, you listen to me.

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:36.294
This is my son.

01:18:37.754 --> 01:18:39.881
And if anything...
anything else happens to him,

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:41.633
I'm coming after you.

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:43.969
And you better pray I don't
put you in a bed next to Joshua

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.846
for a very, very long time.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:47.806
Clear?

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.518
Sure.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.620
Sonny, Sonny.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:12.914
Do you think Joshua blames you
for what happened in Monza?

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:20.046
Sonny, come on.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.507
It was clear
that you were running his race.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:26.052
Look, you kept him out on slick
tires, in dangerous conditions,

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:29.723
that even if you told him not to
pass, wasn't the accident inevitable?

01:19:29.806 --> 01:19:31.641
If I may. If I may.

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:34.060
Joshua's back home, recovering.

01:19:34.144 --> 01:19:36.354
We are expecting his return
in a few weeks.

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:42.277
Until that moment, our reserve driver,
Luca Cortez right there, will drive and...

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.571
-Next man up.
-Answer the question!

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:50.202
A chaotic week
for Expensify Apex GP,

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:53.371
and again, it's Sonny Hayes
at the center.

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:57.083
Many are blaming him for his
teammate's horrific accident at Monza.

01:19:57.167 --> 01:20:01.797
His high-stakes, gambling style of
racing has the whole grid on edge,

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.717
and while the controversy
continues over who was to blame,

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:09.179
doctors have said that Pearce
will miss the next three races,

01:20:09.262 --> 01:20:13.183
due to the burns suffered on his hands
as he begins his road to recovery.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.568
Today, we're going
with our combat upgrade.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:27.656
The revised shapes will improve
the flow field under the floor,

01:20:27.739 --> 01:20:31.368
allowing us to run in dirty air
with minimal loss of performance.

01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:34.663
Means we have to keep
the field close at all times,

01:20:34.746 --> 01:20:37.916
and as for
this week's plan C...

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:47.592
They've docked us to the back of the grid
'cause they don't like the way we drive.

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.219
Fine. Fuck 'em.

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:53.849
'Cause if we can pick up
a tenth of a second from you,

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:57.769
and from you,
and you, and me...

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:00.355
If everyone in this room can
make one critical contribution,

01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:02.190
that's a second every lap.

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:07.028
And after 72 laps, that's the
difference between last and first.

01:21:09.072 --> 01:21:09.990
Plan C...

01:21:11.783 --> 01:21:13.368
Plan C's for combat.

01:21:15.996 --> 01:21:21.042
Combat, combat, combat.

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:26.548
Combat, combat,
combat, combat.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.780
And that's Hayes
in the upgraded Apex.

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:54.034
Now the team were penalized
back to last place after Monza,

01:21:54.117 --> 01:21:55.911
but here he is,
coming from the cellar,

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:58.455
passing his new teammate,
Luca Cortez.

01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:07.172
Round the banking,
Hayes has got past Ocon.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:10.675
This is brilliant last lap drama.
What a fantastic finish.

01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:49.881
Another fearless
attack from Hayes.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.801
And here's where the Apex GP
has found strength.

01:22:52.884 --> 01:22:56.805
Three-tenths gained every lap,
and in the corners alone.

01:23:00.183 --> 01:23:01.935
Scrapping away
on the last lap,

01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:05.355
Sonny Hayes gets the inside line,
but he can't quite get past.

01:23:05.438 --> 01:23:07.983
George Russell will hang
on here for sixth place,

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:11.486
but this is Apex GP's
best ever finish.

01:23:11.569 --> 01:23:14.572
-It's a valiant seventh.
-Combat, I love it!

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:20.161
Every race you miss,
fans just forget you.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:22.330
Sonny always seems
to be one step ahead.

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:27.669
You never know.
Sonny may be a saboteur, Josh.

01:23:27.752 --> 01:23:28.878
He may be a saboteur.

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:43.601
...and they go wheel to
wheel, Verstappen and Leclerc.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:46.730
Verstappen will have the inside.
Perez goes round the outside.

01:23:46.813 --> 01:23:49.274
Perez makes contact
with Charles Leclerc

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:53.403
as Sonny Hayes threads that Apex
GP car through the midfield.

01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:25.018
Talk about
leaving it late.

01:24:25.101 --> 01:24:28.730
Hayes squeezes through on the inside,
and with a run to the line now,

01:24:28.813 --> 01:24:31.733
for their best
position ever, P5.

01:24:31.816 --> 01:24:33.735
Give the design
team a bonus,

01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:36.404
because the upgrade has
completely changed this car.

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:38.740
And if Joshua Pearce
is watching,

01:24:38.823 --> 01:24:41.743
well, he must be thinking,
"What might have been?"

01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:49.501
He's treating you
like a pawn, Josh.

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:52.921
Be a knight! Be a knight! Be a knight!

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:59.052
Who would have
believed this weeks ago?

01:24:59.135 --> 01:25:03.098
Expensify Apex GP has the
racing world on notice.

01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:05.850
Apex! Apex! Apex!

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:16.111
Someone call the 1990s.
Sonny Hayes, if you missed him, he's back.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:25.703
Last one up
buys breakfast.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:34.879
Look who's back.

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:42.428
Hello.

01:25:49.727 --> 01:25:51.312
Good to have you back, JP.
We missed you.

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:17.130
Apex! Apex! Apex! Apex!

01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:38.943
It's lights out
and away we go!

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.695
And it's a decent start,

01:26:40.778 --> 01:26:43.489
and everyone keeping it clean
as into La Source we go.

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:45.325
Ferrari ahead of Red Bull,

01:26:45.408 --> 01:26:50.955
but here the two Apex GP cars
looking to work together as a team.

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.958
It's a welcome back to the
track for Joshua Pearce,

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.877
and Sonny Hayes
glad to see him,

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:59.505
as they slice their way through
positions four and five.

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:02.091
And onto the Kemmel
Straight we go.

01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:06.763
Now approaching top speed,
Sonny Hayes ahead of Joshua Pearce.

01:27:06.846 --> 01:27:10.225
He's showing no ill effects from
that time off after the crash.

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:14.020
The car's working beautifully.
They're working as a team.

01:27:14.103 --> 01:27:17.690
But hang on, Pearce right on his
tail, using the slipstream.

01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:20.193
Is he about to try
and overtake?

01:27:20.276 --> 01:27:22.987
Into the chicane we go
and they touch wheels!

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:24.989
This is disaster for Apex...

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:28.534
...as out goes Sonny Hayes
and into the gravel!

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.496
Assholes!

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:34.916
What is happening
with this team?

01:27:34.999 --> 01:27:38.795
Their first race back together,
and they've run into each other.

01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:42.006
-You did great, Joshua.
-Well done, mate.

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:45.218
Whoo!

01:27:45.301 --> 01:27:47.845
You pull that shit again,
I will knock your teeth out.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.931
Oh, no one gets past us
without a fight, right?

01:27:50.014 --> 01:27:51.849
Oh, is this funny?
You think you got a seat next year?

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:54.018
'Cause you just
cut your chances in half.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:56.604
-That's how dumb you are.
-You failed. You failed!

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:58.064
-Why should I listen to you anyway, man?
-Hey.

01:28:00.608 --> 01:28:03.152
Look, man.
I don't give two shits about you.

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.571
You wanna sabotage your career,
you go right ahead.

01:28:05.655 --> 01:28:07.824
I've seen hundreds of guys
with your talent come and go.

01:28:07.907 --> 01:28:09.617
No one cares!

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:13.663
But you sabotage Ruben, who backed you?
You sabotage his team?

01:28:15.206 --> 01:28:16.416
I won't let you do it.

01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:25.049
-Thanks, coach.
-Get your shit together!

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.719
So stupid! God...

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.478
How would
you sum up your race today?

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:40.690
Ooh. Um, it was good.

01:28:40.773 --> 01:28:43.276
You know, the car feels great.
I think the team's done an amazing job.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:46.487
It's just a shame
about the contact with Sonny.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:48.698
You hate to see that happen.

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.102
-Hey, how are you doing?
-Hi, how are you?

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:19.520
Good. Sensational.

01:29:22.273 --> 01:29:24.067
-Where's the team?
-Right this way, gentlemen.

01:29:34.994 --> 01:29:37.663
Brilliant, you made it.
Come on. Sit down.

01:29:40.124 --> 01:29:41.834
Sonny, you know Joshua.

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:44.337
Joshua, Sonny.

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.339
So I'm sure you both
have heard the rumors.

01:29:46.422 --> 01:29:49.384
We all lose our jobs if you
can't pull off a miracle,

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:51.552
and that's starting with
staying on the bloody track.

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:53.721
Well, we were doing just fine
while JP was out.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:54.972
I was out because
I was listening to you.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:56.641
-Ish.
-And please don't call me JP.

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.518
It's a nickname.
You don't get to choose.

01:29:58.601 --> 01:30:00.686
And your name doesn't even make sense.
Is it Sonny, is it Hayesie?

01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:01.646
We don't know, do we, Kate?

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:03.272
Lads.

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:04.524
Have I not delivered you a car?

01:30:07.735 --> 01:30:09.695
So you can do one thing for me.

01:30:09.779 --> 01:30:11.072
Cards.

01:30:11.155 --> 01:30:13.241
Come on.
I know you have 'em with ya.

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:16.661
It's my team meeting,
we're gonna do it my way.

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.579
-We're playing poker.
-Come on.

01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:21.332
Yeah. Whoever wins gets to be
our number one driver tomorrow,

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:23.126
and if I win, I get to choose.

01:30:25.461 --> 01:30:27.130
-Didn't he gamble for a living?
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:28.714
Now he's living in a van.

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:31.509
Texas Hold'em?

01:30:46.232 --> 01:30:48.609
So, Sonny here
likes straight talk.

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:50.361
Isn't that right, Sonny?

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:52.363
-Yeah, that's what I hear.
-So, let's talk.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:53.573
Who wants to go first?

01:30:53.656 --> 01:30:55.324
-I'll go first.
-I'll go first.

01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:57.160
No, I'll go first.

01:30:57.243 --> 01:31:00.455
What's the difference between
Joshua Pearce and Sonny Hayes?

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:01.831
A lot of decades.

01:31:01.914 --> 01:31:04.000
-Hard-won experience.
-Of living in a van?

01:31:04.083 --> 01:31:05.126
Total freedom.

01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:06.544
Total failure.

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:08.754
Says the guy who
still lives with his mom.

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:10.465
Says the guy with two pair.

01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:13.134
-Says the guy with trips.
-Says the guy with a full house.

01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:17.430
Girl.

01:31:17.513 --> 01:31:18.973
Wait, I don't even
live with my mum.

01:31:19.056 --> 01:31:20.349
Okay.

01:31:20.433 --> 01:31:22.185
She just cooks
for me sometimes.

01:31:22.268 --> 01:31:23.603
Mm-hmm.

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:28.441
If you'd any constructive criticism
for each other, what would it be?

01:31:28.524 --> 01:31:29.901
-Don't be such an arsehole.
-Don't be such a dickhead.

01:31:32.278 --> 01:31:33.070
That was constructive.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:38.493
You have a deficient
frontal cortex.

01:31:40.411 --> 01:31:42.246
-A what?
-You can't analyze risk.

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:45.583
It's not all your fault.
It's not fully formed yet at your age.

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:47.418
But come the day
you learn patience,

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:49.629
-and stop being so immature, thinking--
-Patience.

01:31:49.712 --> 01:31:51.464
-Patience is good.
-Patience.

01:31:52.465 --> 01:31:53.508
Joshua.

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:57.595
He doesn't care about what anyone
else has to say but himself.

01:31:57.678 --> 01:32:01.098
He just comes in and imposes his
will on all of us with no discussion.

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:03.518
He doesn't listen.
I'm trying, but he doesn't listen.

01:32:03.601 --> 01:32:05.269
Mmm.

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.605
-Sonny?
-What?

01:32:10.066 --> 01:32:12.777
Wow.

01:32:26.082 --> 01:32:27.208
Who taught you how to play?

01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:29.377
My dad liked to gamble.

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:32.380
-He make big bets too?
-Put a big one on me.

01:32:32.463 --> 01:32:33.965
How old were you
when your fathers died?

01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:39.679
Sorry.

01:32:39.762 --> 01:32:40.846
-Thirteen.
-Thirteen.

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:45.101
Huh.

01:32:46.143 --> 01:32:47.687
Why do you race?

01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:51.732
Money... ...fame
and free clothes.

01:32:51.816 --> 01:32:53.859
Oh, my God, with the phone.
Put the thing down, will ya?

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:55.695
What do you care what they say?

01:32:55.778 --> 01:32:57.572
Easy for you to say.
They all love you.

01:32:57.655 --> 01:32:58.698
It's just noise, man.

01:33:00.366 --> 01:33:02.076
Drive the car.

01:33:02.159 --> 01:33:03.286
You're really good at it.

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:07.582
You might be great.

01:33:48.039 --> 01:33:50.458
Yeah.

01:33:50.541 --> 01:33:53.461
Look at that, huh?
Number one driver tomorrow.

01:33:53.544 --> 01:33:55.171
-Bonding?
-Ooh.

01:33:55.254 --> 01:33:56.464
Well, this is nice.

01:33:56.547 --> 01:33:58.132
We gotta go, mate.
Sponsor party at OMNIA.

01:33:58.215 --> 01:33:59.634
Gotta steal ya.

01:33:59.717 --> 01:34:02.094
Uh, Uncle Sonny,
you're welcome to come with--

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:03.638
Thank you, I'm good.
I have a race tomorrow.

01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:07.516
-Cool. Kate?
-No, thank you.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.894
-Come on.
-Thanks for this, Kate.

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:13.064
Come on, boy. Uh...
Uh, girls, you might have to...

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.899
We're gonna go dancing.
Should we go dancing?

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:16.817
Yeah!

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:29.830
Listen,

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:33.417
let's get this straight, okay?

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:36.796
I don't mess around during the season,
and never with a member of my team,

01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:39.131
and what I'm attracted
to is winning.

01:34:39.215 --> 01:34:40.883
And you just lost
to a pair of fives.

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:41.902
Hey.

01:35:43.154 --> 01:35:44.488
You're a driver, aren't you?

01:35:45.656 --> 01:35:47.074
-Yeah.
-Which team?

01:35:47.158 --> 01:35:48.492
Apex GP.

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:50.745
Can you introduce me
to Carlos Sainz?

01:35:52.455 --> 01:35:53.622
I'll go get him.

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.464
Oh, hey. Hey.

01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:04.425
Oi, why do they say this place
is weird? I like this, bruv.

01:36:04.508 --> 01:36:06.635
Glad you're having fun, man.
Be safe. I'm gonna leave, yeah?

01:36:06.719 --> 01:36:08.053
-Huh?
-I said I'm gonna cut.

01:36:08.137 --> 01:36:09.722
Oh, wait, no, no, no.
You just got here!

01:36:09.805 --> 01:36:11.140
I just... I'm not feeling it.

01:36:11.223 --> 01:36:13.476
What do you mean?
We just got here, bruv. Josh!

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.201
Hey.

01:37:16.914 --> 01:37:18.249
I shouldn't drink tequila.

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:24.505
Last night was Ruben's idea?

01:37:24.588 --> 01:37:26.799
Yeah, the first part.

01:37:26.882 --> 01:37:29.760
-Well...
-Not the second!

01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:41.105
Come on.

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.275
Why are you here, Sonny, huh?

01:37:47.611 --> 01:37:49.530
Not much of a story.

01:37:55.411 --> 01:37:56.245
Okay.

01:37:58.289 --> 01:37:59.957
I'm here to prove
everyone wrong.

01:38:02.084 --> 01:38:04.670
My ex, my old boss,

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:08.591
my first-year
uni physics professor--

01:38:08.674 --> 01:38:10.134
-That bastard.
-Yeah.

01:38:12.469 --> 01:38:14.597
And until we win, I haven't.

01:38:16.098 --> 01:38:20.185
So, unfortunately,
I now rely on you.

01:38:20.269 --> 01:38:21.061
Mmm.

01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:28.569
I was gonna be world champion.

01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:31.697
The best there ever was.

01:38:33.532 --> 01:38:35.576
I'm just a kid and I'm on
the track with my idols,

01:38:35.659 --> 01:38:37.953
Senna, Mansell, Prost.

01:38:38.037 --> 01:38:39.496
And I am quick.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.333
I'm fearless.

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:45.502
I was next.

01:38:48.505 --> 01:38:49.506
And then...

01:38:53.052 --> 01:38:54.470
...it was all taken away.

01:38:56.889 --> 01:38:58.098
The crash, huh?

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.604
So I lost my seat, my money,
my sanity, my...

01:39:04.521 --> 01:39:05.689
myself, really.

01:39:07.107 --> 01:39:12.237
Just became this angry,
resentful shithead.

01:39:12.321 --> 01:39:15.658
Not someone
I'm particularly proud of.

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:22.498
Till one day, I realized
what I had really lost,

01:39:22.581 --> 01:39:27.670
and it wasn't the titles,
or the trophies, or the records.

01:39:27.753 --> 01:39:30.923
It was my love for racing.

01:39:33.717 --> 01:39:34.969
So I started driving.

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:40.057
Didn't matter the car, the circuit,
didn't need anyone to watch.

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:43.727
Just as long as I was behind the
wheel, I was good.

01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:48.273
Sometimes...

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.494
What? Come on.

01:40:04.206 --> 01:40:09.545
It's rare, but sometimes,
there's this moment in the car

01:40:09.628 --> 01:40:12.172
where everything goes quiet,

01:40:13.007 --> 01:40:14.550
my heartbeat slows,

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:17.177
it's peaceful,

01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:21.015
and I can see everything,
and no one...

01:40:21.765 --> 01:40:23.267
no one can touch me.

01:40:26.562 --> 01:40:29.273
And I am chasing that moment
every time I get in the car.

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:37.156
I don't know when I'll find it
again, but, man, I want to.

01:40:37.948 --> 01:40:39.199
I want to.

01:40:41.076 --> 01:40:44.121
'Cause in that moment,
I'm flying.

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:07.811
Kate.

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:09.480
-Ruben.
-Where is he?

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:10.731
Where's who?

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:13.150
What are you talking about?

01:41:14.818 --> 01:41:16.070
Ruben, seriously?

01:41:17.279 --> 01:41:19.948
One, how dare you?

01:41:20.032 --> 01:41:22.367
Two, I respect
professional boundaries.

01:41:23.327 --> 01:41:24.078
And three...

01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:28.332
Three, yeah, he's on...
he's on the balcony.

01:41:31.627 --> 01:41:33.504
-Well, you're up early.
-Get dressed.

01:41:33.587 --> 01:41:35.422
-Yeah, what's going on?
-They're coming for our car.

01:41:39.426 --> 01:41:42.221
It's my duty to inform
you that we've received an anonymous tip

01:41:42.304 --> 01:41:44.556
that your upgraded floor
is in violation.

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.933
From who?

01:41:46.016 --> 01:41:47.601
-I can't say.
-Ah.

01:41:47.684 --> 01:41:50.395
Sir, we submitted
the drawings long ago.

01:41:50.479 --> 01:41:51.522
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:52.815
And you approved them all.

01:41:52.898 --> 01:41:55.067
It's whether the parts
you're racing with

01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:57.361
were developed outside
of your facility.

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:59.071
What? That's insane.

01:41:59.154 --> 01:42:01.824
Based on the paperwork we've
received, there are concerns.

01:42:01.907 --> 01:42:04.243
Hang on, where'd you get these?
These are internal documents.

01:42:04.326 --> 01:42:06.703
This team doesn't break any
rules, sir. No, no.

01:42:06.787 --> 01:42:07.871
I'll take that
with a pinch of salt.

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:09.790
Someone can
fabricate documents.

01:42:09.873 --> 01:42:11.250
Your car's under review.

01:42:11.333 --> 01:42:12.459
-You know the procedure.
-What?

01:42:12.543 --> 01:42:14.586
You cannot race
unless you substitute

01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:16.797
the previously
approved components.

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.799
-No!
-Do you mean our old design?

01:42:18.882 --> 01:42:20.300
A shit box!

01:42:20.384 --> 01:42:21.885
No lo puedo creer.

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:23.554
Where were you
the last two years? Why now?

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:26.098
Because we might actually
win a race? Is that it?

01:42:26.181 --> 01:42:29.143
This is not car racing, sir,
this is like corporate espionage!

01:42:29.226 --> 01:42:31.061
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Come... Come here.

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:33.230
I'm talking to you! Sir!

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:34.857
Without the upgrade,
we're screwed.

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:04.887
Sonny, let it go.
Focus on a clean start.

01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:07.014
We'll never win clean.

01:43:07.097 --> 01:43:09.099
Can we just not break
any rules?

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:11.435
Yeah, the rules are always
against us though, aren't they?

01:43:15.272 --> 01:43:17.691
Get them safe
through lap one.

01:43:17.774 --> 01:43:20.444
Sonny, we just need
to keep it in one piece. Okay?

01:43:25.741 --> 01:43:27.034
Sonny?

01:43:51.642 --> 01:43:54.311
-Oi, what the hell?
-I don't know!

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:55.646
What's wrong with Sonny?

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.940
Joshua, yep. Keep focused.
You're still good.

01:43:58.023 --> 01:43:58.815
What's he doing?

01:44:05.447 --> 01:44:06.615
He's driving angry.

01:44:07.491 --> 01:44:08.659
Not good. It's not good.

01:44:16.166 --> 01:44:17.960
Sonny, we need
to make these tires last.

01:44:18.043 --> 01:44:19.336
Take it easy.

01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:28.762
No, he's put the car
in qualifying mode.

01:44:28.845 --> 01:44:31.098
He's gonna run the battery down.
Tell him to put it back.

01:44:31.181 --> 01:44:32.516
Sonny, you're in qualifying mode.
What's going on?

01:44:34.184 --> 01:44:34.935
Sonny, what's happening?

01:44:45.279 --> 01:44:49.825
...blasting along Las
Vegas Boulevard, 210 miles an hour.

01:44:49.908 --> 01:44:52.244
Hard on the brakes now,
and into the chicane.

01:44:52.327 --> 01:44:56.999
Sergio Perez, ahead of Sonny Hayes,
but that's a mega exit from Hayes.

01:44:57.082 --> 01:45:00.002
He's gotta gain on Sergio
Perez, and he's closing.

01:45:00.085 --> 01:45:02.754
Meter by meter. Inch by inch.

01:45:02.838 --> 01:45:04.548
Is this the place
to take a gamble?

01:45:04.631 --> 01:45:06.717
Hayes attacks
round the outside.

01:45:15.684 --> 01:45:16.476
No! No!

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:43.587
Why do we do this?

01:45:45.339 --> 01:45:48.091
What's wrong
with tennis, huh?

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.676
Or golf.

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.345
Right?

01:45:54.765 --> 01:45:55.515
Christ.

01:45:57.726 --> 01:45:59.102
We are totally insane.

01:46:04.107 --> 01:46:06.360
"C5 neck fracture.

01:46:07.778 --> 01:46:08.695
Spinal contusion.

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:12.449
Compressed thoracic vertebrae.

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:16.620
Further blunt force impact trauma
likely to result in vision loss,

01:46:16.703 --> 01:46:18.455
paralysis, death."

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:23.502
Really lead with the good news,
don't they?

01:46:23.585 --> 01:46:25.796
This is a report
from 30 years ago.

01:46:27.714 --> 01:46:28.924
Why didn't you tell me?

01:46:31.968 --> 01:46:33.970
You never should
have raced again, Sonny.

01:46:35.764 --> 01:46:37.933
How... How do you think I'd
feel if you die on the track?

01:46:40.102 --> 01:46:41.269
Revenge for Monaco.

01:46:41.353 --> 01:46:42.771
It's not a joke!

01:46:46.316 --> 01:46:47.567
It's me who's liable, Sonny.

01:46:48.985 --> 01:46:50.529
And don't think there's
some bullshit loophole

01:46:50.612 --> 01:46:51.863
to get you out of this.

01:46:51.947 --> 01:46:53.532
-No.
-Ruben, we're drivers.

01:46:53.615 --> 01:46:55.992
We are not drivers, not anymore.
I'm sorry. We're not.

01:46:57.994 --> 01:46:59.371
We're losers.

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:02.499
We're a pair of dumb,

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:04.501
sentimental,

01:47:06.044 --> 01:47:07.087
broke losers.

01:47:13.009 --> 01:47:14.261
Okay. You're off the team.

01:47:19.433 --> 01:47:22.853
Your van is in the garage
with all your stuff in it, and...

01:47:29.985 --> 01:47:31.945
I never should have pulled you
into this, Sonny.

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.573
I'm sorry.

01:47:37.033 --> 01:47:38.243
Ruben, wait!

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:45.041
I need this.

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:50.297
No one drives forever, Sonny.

01:47:51.882 --> 01:47:52.632
Not even you.

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:12.486
Pippa, load up Monza.
Just like it happened. In the rain.

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:16.531
Joshua,
Sonny says wait for the straight,

01:48:16.615 --> 01:48:18.575
the straight into turn one.

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:27.667
Run it again, please.

01:48:32.547 --> 01:48:35.008
...wait for the
straight, the straight into turn one.

01:48:37.761 --> 01:48:39.596
Run it again, please.

01:48:49.481 --> 01:48:51.233
The straight into turn one.

01:48:57.781 --> 01:49:01.743
Whoo!

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:19.886
Sonny.

01:49:21.221 --> 01:49:22.264
Sonny.

01:49:23.557 --> 01:49:25.475
Hey. You're not in Abu Dhabi?

01:49:25.559 --> 01:49:28.144
I fly out tonight. I, uh...

01:49:28.228 --> 01:49:29.354
Yeah, I wanted to catch you.

01:49:30.939 --> 01:49:32.774
So, listen.

01:49:32.857 --> 01:49:36.861
We both know that the board's wanted
to unload Apex from the start,

01:49:36.945 --> 01:49:39.990
but, yeah, then you rode
into town,

01:49:40.073 --> 01:49:42.826
raised our whole profile,
and now I've, uh...

01:49:42.909 --> 01:49:44.953
Yeah, I've got...
I've got buyers lining up.

01:49:47.122 --> 01:49:49.165
-Uh-huh.
-Gotta be honest with you, man,

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:51.918
I thought you were gonna be the...
the final nail in the coffin.

01:49:52.002 --> 01:49:54.129
But now I see the play.

01:49:54.212 --> 01:49:57.757
And I want you
as part of the package.

01:50:01.177 --> 01:50:02.137
What sort of package?

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:06.141
I've set up a sale
where I run the team,

01:50:06.224 --> 01:50:07.726
and keep you on for strategy,

01:50:08.602 --> 01:50:09.603
maybe even team principal.

01:50:11.396 --> 01:50:14.858
With the money from that deal,
I can make you a very rich man.

01:50:16.151 --> 01:50:17.611
Here's the thing.

01:50:17.694 --> 01:50:19.904
With the...
the changing regulations,

01:50:19.988 --> 01:50:22.907
new Mercedes power unit,
Kate's aero, two new drivers...

01:50:24.618 --> 01:50:26.453
we've got a real shot
at the championship next year.

01:50:27.829 --> 01:50:29.122
What about Ruben?

01:50:29.205 --> 01:50:29.956
Don't worry.

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:32.292
You know.

01:50:32.375 --> 01:50:34.294
We won't embarrass him.

01:50:34.377 --> 01:50:36.630
We'll keep him on with a...
with a title, or brand ambassador...

01:50:37.464 --> 01:50:38.590
You know, something.

01:50:42.719 --> 01:50:44.054
And I get final say?

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:45.388
Don't change a thing.

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:46.431
Do what you do, man.

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:49.100
And that's the irony here.

01:50:49.184 --> 01:50:51.978
You know, the board
originally approved your hire

01:50:52.062 --> 01:50:53.480
because we thought
you'd help us lose.

01:50:54.606 --> 01:50:55.774
-Sorry to make you sweat.
-Hey.

01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:58.568
That's my number.

01:50:58.652 --> 01:51:00.487
Talk to your people.

01:51:00.570 --> 01:51:04.157
But, uh...
...right after the race,

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:06.826
I, uh... I wanna lock down
the deal, okay?

01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:08.870
-So, by Sunday?
-Perfect.

01:51:10.288 --> 01:51:12.666
Listen, this thing
can be your legacy, you know?

01:51:15.085 --> 01:51:16.086
An F1 champion.

01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:18.672
What you always wanted, right?

01:51:22.634 --> 01:51:26.012
It was you who forged those
documents, wasn't it?

01:51:26.096 --> 01:51:26.846
Huh.

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:35.063
-You're a killer, man, aren't you?
-Hey. I'm a winner.

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:39.234
Aren't you, huh?

01:51:41.403 --> 01:51:42.404
Okay.

01:51:45.657 --> 01:51:47.826
Oh, hey. How's the back?

01:51:48.827 --> 01:51:49.994
Better.

01:51:50.078 --> 01:51:51.329
I've got an amazing guy.
I'll, uh...

01:51:51.413 --> 01:51:52.539
I'll hook you up.

01:51:53.915 --> 01:51:54.916
Hail Mary.

01:52:22.444 --> 01:52:23.570
You good?

01:52:28.491 --> 01:52:32.078
Listen, Mum,
I've gotta tell you something.

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:41.004
In Monza, right before the crash,
it was my decision to make the move.

01:52:42.756 --> 01:52:44.174
Sonny actually told me to wait.

01:52:53.308 --> 01:52:54.517
Family.

01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:57.103
I've been working the phones
with IndyCar,

01:52:57.187 --> 01:52:58.688
and I think I can get you
a test drive, bruv.

01:52:58.772 --> 01:52:59.773
-Hello, Auntie.
-Hi.

01:53:01.399 --> 01:53:03.693
They're trying to pull in
a new demographic, obviously.

01:53:03.777 --> 01:53:07.322
And the ladies love that smile.

01:53:07.405 --> 01:53:10.074
And we can throw in some
incentives, like flights and cars.

01:53:10.158 --> 01:53:11.951
Listen, Cash, you can go.
I don't need you today.

01:53:13.036 --> 01:53:14.704
Nah, mate. You got media next.

01:53:14.788 --> 01:53:17.040
I don't care.
They can fine me.

01:53:17.999 --> 01:53:19.000
Besides,

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:21.711
that's not why
I'm doing it, right?

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:24.923
Josh, starting tomorrow,
we're not "doing it" anywhere.

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.134
It's all just noise.

01:53:29.302 --> 01:53:30.887
Media, engagement, followers.

01:53:32.138 --> 01:53:35.099
Listen, I've gotta focus
on the race.

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:38.728
Auntie, please.

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.648
Well, you heard the man.

01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.159
-Deal.
-Deal.

01:53:56.371 --> 01:53:58.414
-Yo.
-Hey.

01:53:58.498 --> 01:53:59.916
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:54:02.836 --> 01:54:05.171
Guys, what's happening?

01:54:05.255 --> 01:54:08.258
Parc fermé.
Waiting for FIA to cut the seals.

01:54:08.341 --> 01:54:10.760
Oh, good.

01:54:10.844 --> 01:54:13.179
-We got time then.
-For what?

01:54:14.389 --> 01:54:15.390
For...

01:54:18.601 --> 01:54:20.812
No, no, no.

01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:28.945
Welcome to the Paddock Club,
for our most valued guests.

01:54:29.028 --> 01:54:32.949
Please, uh, grab a drink,
make yourselves at home,

01:54:33.032 --> 01:54:36.870
and, uh, enjoy the very best view
there is of, uh... of Formula 1.

01:54:39.205 --> 01:54:40.582
Okay? Okay.

01:54:58.516 --> 01:55:00.476
Hey, guys, don't stop!
Keep going!

01:55:36.346 --> 01:55:39.015
No way.

01:55:46.856 --> 01:55:49.484
Jesús, it's like
a morgue around here.

01:55:51.903 --> 01:55:53.529
How'd you get here?

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:54.864
Premium economy.

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:01.037
What? What is this?

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:02.872
Well, that's my
bullshit loophole.

01:56:02.956 --> 01:56:05.124
Oh, no, forget it.
I'm not even going to read that.

01:56:05.208 --> 01:56:07.669
That is a real legal document
from a real Tijuana lawyer...

01:56:07.752 --> 01:56:09.462
...waiving all liability to you

01:56:09.545 --> 01:56:11.965
and your company vis-à-vis
this race, myself, and me.

01:56:13.091 --> 01:56:14.133
And...

01:56:17.136 --> 01:56:20.139
...since you owe me my last paycheck,
technically I'm still on this team.

01:56:25.728 --> 01:56:27.855
Kate, where's the shitbox?

01:56:27.939 --> 01:56:30.233
The FIA confirmed that
the documents were forged,

01:56:30.316 --> 01:56:32.110
and they were sent
by someone from Apex.

01:56:33.152 --> 01:56:34.946
Huh.

01:56:35.029 --> 01:56:37.991
Okay, I don't care
about your loophole. I don't.

01:56:38.074 --> 01:56:39.909
That is my car.
You are not racing it.

01:56:39.993 --> 01:56:41.160
-Ruben.
-No, Sonny.

01:56:41.244 --> 01:56:42.370
Listen,

01:56:43.955 --> 01:56:45.456
I can't let you do that.

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:46.582
I can't.

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:47.834
Okay?

01:56:50.003 --> 01:56:53.006
If the last thing I do is drive that
car, I will take that life, man.

01:56:57.135 --> 01:56:58.386
A thousand times.

01:57:03.349 --> 01:57:04.392
We can't win.

01:57:06.436 --> 01:57:07.729
We can't if we don't try.

01:57:54.317 --> 01:57:55.735
How come you never look
at the card?

01:57:55.818 --> 01:57:56.778
What card?

01:58:38.277 --> 01:58:40.571
Welcome to the very final spots
on the grid.

01:58:40.655 --> 01:58:43.116
And as ever,
we'll go from last to first.

01:58:43.199 --> 01:58:45.118
And breaking news here in P22,

01:58:45.201 --> 01:58:46.702
because we're hearing
the Apex GP team have made...

01:58:46.786 --> 01:58:48.454
-Hey, Peter.
-Yeah?

01:58:48.538 --> 01:58:50.581
That's your guy. Isn't it?

01:58:50.665 --> 01:58:54.627
...being replaced by Sonny Hayes, who
didn't even make the trip to Abu Dhabi...

01:58:54.710 --> 01:58:57.130
Uh, will you excuse me for one second?
I'm really sorry.

01:58:57.213 --> 01:59:00.007
Now, the rules require that he has
to start at the back of the pack.

01:59:00.091 --> 01:59:02.677
Excuse me. What the hell?

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:04.637
What?

01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:09.934
You still got my phone?

01:59:29.162 --> 01:59:30.621
-Good luck today.
-You too, James.

01:59:30.705 --> 01:59:31.998
Excuse me. Hey, Sonny. Sonny!

01:59:32.081 --> 01:59:33.666
Hey, look,
I know we've had our differences,

01:59:33.749 --> 01:59:35.751
-but look, this is your last F1 race.
-Chaz! This guy.

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:36.961
Any thought...

01:59:39.172 --> 01:59:40.173
What's that?

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:45.469
Bloody hell.

01:59:47.597 --> 01:59:48.681
Bloody hell!

02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:10.286
Elbows out?

02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:12.121
Elbows out.

02:00:14.373 --> 02:00:19.795
All set for our season finale
here in Abu Dhabi where it's lights out.

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:23.090
And away we go.
Good start there for Joshua Pearce.

02:00:23.174 --> 02:00:25.635
Drivers jockeying for position

02:00:25.718 --> 02:00:30.306
as we head full-throttle down the
main straight and into turn one.

02:00:30.389 --> 02:00:32.725
Tricky first corner,
and going wide,

02:00:32.808 --> 02:00:35.186
the Aston Martin
and the AlphaTauri

02:00:35.269 --> 02:00:37.521
as Pearce picks up two places.

02:00:37.605 --> 02:00:40.066
Yes, Pearce showing
some real maturity there.

02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:43.778
He saw a bad situation before it
happened and he's off to a great start.

02:01:02.463 --> 02:01:03.673
Don't even think about it.

02:01:19.897 --> 02:01:22.566
Here comes the Alpine
down the inside. Contact!

02:01:24.235 --> 02:01:27.029
And three days out of
hospital, Hayes will feel that.

02:01:37.081 --> 02:01:39.166
Gained places, guys.
We're alive.

02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:40.751
I hope he hasn't
damaged the car,

02:01:40.835 --> 02:01:43.713
but despite everything,
it's still a great first lap.

02:01:43.796 --> 02:01:45.798
It is! Hayes in P16.

02:01:45.881 --> 02:01:48.301
Pearce, his teammate,
up to P9.

02:01:50.511 --> 02:01:53.723
Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari
holding on to the lead.

02:01:53.806 --> 02:01:55.683
Apex in the midfield.

02:01:55.766 --> 02:01:58.436
Let's see if they can do
anything to shake up this race.

02:01:58.519 --> 02:01:59.645
Gap to leader?

02:01:59.729 --> 02:02:00.563
Fifteen seconds.

02:02:02.064 --> 02:02:04.483
Keep JP plus 20 seconds.
Plus 20.

02:02:04.567 --> 02:02:06.736
-Length of a pit stop.
-You know why.

02:02:08.654 --> 02:02:10.531
It's a busy race
for Sonny Hayes,

02:02:10.614 --> 02:02:13.451
and now here comes Kevin
Magnussen looking to make a move.

02:02:13.534 --> 02:02:15.453
And this could spell trouble.

02:02:15.536 --> 02:02:17.079
There's history
between these two.

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:20.624
Often, the irresistible force
meets the immovable object.

02:02:20.708 --> 02:02:22.626
And Magnussen,
looking down the inside,

02:02:22.710 --> 02:02:26.172
-locks up and hits Hayes.
-Box, box. Box, box, box.

02:02:26.255 --> 02:02:27.465
Copy, coming in for hards.

02:02:28.924 --> 02:02:30.259
Damn.

02:02:31.886 --> 02:02:34.889
Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
Here we go, boys.

02:02:42.271 --> 02:02:44.106
Hayes exit the pits.

02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:46.650
He had to come in because
of that damage to his tire.

02:02:46.734 --> 02:02:50.529
But what of Joshua Pearce?
Where do Apex GP go with him?

02:02:52.406 --> 02:02:54.325
Guys, am I boxing?
What's the plan?

02:02:54.408 --> 02:02:56.702
Plan C, Plan C.
Stay out. Stay out.

02:02:56.786 --> 02:02:59.663
-Chaos.
-Copy that.

02:02:59.747 --> 02:03:02.875
Joshua slows down the leaders for Sonny.
Sonny does the same for him.

02:03:04.377 --> 02:03:06.170
Pearce stays out.

02:03:06.253 --> 02:03:09.215
It's a strategy that Apex
have used before this season.

02:03:09.298 --> 02:03:10.925
It helps them with
track position for now,

02:03:11.008 --> 02:03:12.802
but they gotta keep
these tires alive.

02:03:16.722 --> 02:03:18.307
It's the only way
we keep this close.

02:03:18.391 --> 02:03:20.101
And then we need luck.

02:03:20.184 --> 02:03:21.310
I'm way ahead of ya.

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:25.940
Lap 25,

02:03:26.023 --> 02:03:28.150
and every driver
so far has pitted, bar one.

02:03:28.234 --> 02:03:30.236
And he leads the race.

02:03:30.319 --> 02:03:33.239
Joshua Pearce controlling
the pace out in front.

02:03:33.322 --> 02:03:34.949
And that gives
his teammate, Hayes,

02:03:35.032 --> 02:03:37.535
a chance to maintain
his position in the midfield

02:03:37.618 --> 02:03:40.663
despite the contact,
puncture and pit stop.

02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:42.248
They're working
really well together.

02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:45.543
How's JP doing up there?

02:03:45.626 --> 02:03:46.627
He's keeping
the leaders at bay.

02:03:46.710 --> 02:03:48.587
DRS active
next straight, Sonny.

02:03:48.671 --> 02:03:49.547
Got it.

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:52.341
Onto the back straight.

02:03:52.425 --> 02:03:54.552
He's enjoying this new upgrade,

02:03:54.635 --> 02:03:57.596
and he's got DRS,
and he's got Pierre Gasly.

02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:59.432
Sonny Hayes up into P15.

02:04:01.225 --> 02:04:03.352
Sonny, you have got the pace.
Keep pushing.

02:04:03.436 --> 02:04:06.147
Pearce has been
doing a great job out front

02:04:06.230 --> 02:04:09.733
despite the used tires,
but that moment is nearly over now.

02:04:09.817 --> 02:04:12.611
Verstappen up the inside
and he's through.

02:04:12.695 --> 02:04:15.114
Fabulous first stint
from Joshua Pearce.

02:04:15.197 --> 02:04:17.408
Max has passed,
and his troubles don't end there.

02:04:18.826 --> 02:04:20.953
Here comes Charles Leclerc.

02:04:21.036 --> 02:04:25.124
It's another overtake.
Pearce lost the lead and drops now to P3.

02:04:25.207 --> 02:04:27.543
Sorry, guys.
My rear tires are shot.

02:04:27.626 --> 02:04:29.378
Copy that. Box, JP. Box, box.

02:04:31.088 --> 02:04:33.340
Pearce stretching
those tires to the limit.

02:04:33.424 --> 02:04:36.051
Short-term pain
for long-term gain.

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:47.563
And he exits the pit.
He'll have fresher tires.

02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:50.816
He can now attack in the
second half of the race.

02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:53.068
Sonny, the three leaders
are still on hards.

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:55.321
They're gonna have to stop again.
This is their pit window.

02:04:55.404 --> 02:04:57.907
One of the leaders is gonna undercut.
I need to be there when they do.

02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.577
P3 Ferrari. Pippa,
can he beat it to one?

02:05:04.497 --> 02:05:05.831
Depends on their stop.

02:05:05.915 --> 02:05:07.416
Will the undercut
work for Ferrari?

02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.627
Five point eight.
He needs to pick up half a second.

02:05:11.879 --> 02:05:14.381
Sonny, you need half a second.
Go, go, go, go, go.

02:05:14.465 --> 02:05:15.758
And Sonny Hayes
is on the charge.

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:18.385
Under the track
goes the Ferrari.

02:05:18.469 --> 02:05:20.387
Through the first corner
goes Sonny Hayes.

02:05:20.471 --> 02:05:23.057
It's neck and neck.
It's really tight.

02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:26.810
Sonny Hayes is just ahead
of Carlos Sainz.

02:05:26.894 --> 02:05:28.979
-Yes! Come on!
-It's worked so far for Apex GP.

02:05:29.063 --> 02:05:31.106
But their trouble's not over.

02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:35.194
Down the inside, there's a chance
for Carlos Sainz, and he takes it.

02:05:35.277 --> 02:05:36.695
But he locks up.

02:05:36.779 --> 02:05:39.281
The Ferrari goes wide
and Sonny Hayes says,

02:05:39.365 --> 02:05:41.700
"Thank you very much indeed."

02:05:43.744 --> 02:05:45.871
How are they staying so close
to the lead?

02:05:45.955 --> 02:05:49.667
Uh, they're, um...
They're working together.

02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:52.628
Two Apex cars in the top
10, but still a long way to go.

02:05:54.964 --> 02:05:58.801
Twenty laps remaining, and
Apex has worked their way up the order.

02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:01.011
We're now at
the final pit stop window.

02:06:01.095 --> 02:06:03.847
This is our chance for P1.
Make sure JP beats them out.

02:06:03.931 --> 02:06:07.768
Hamilton and Leclerc come
into the pits, but Pearce stays out.

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:12.273
-Talk to me. Can I catch 'em?
-Yep. They're just coming out.

02:06:12.356 --> 02:06:14.108
Push now.
Push now. Push, push.

02:06:14.191 --> 02:06:15.985
Copy. Pushing.

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:17.820
Oh, this
is gonna be close.

02:06:17.903 --> 02:06:20.864
Joshua Pearce inching ahead.
Staying ahead.

02:06:20.948 --> 02:06:23.450
For the second time
in this race, he leads.

02:06:23.534 --> 02:06:24.577
Let's go!

02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:26.287
Yes.

02:06:26.370 --> 02:06:29.415
You are P1, Joshua.

02:06:29.498 --> 02:06:31.959
But Pearce will have
a hard time holding them off

02:06:32.042 --> 02:06:34.712
with Hamilton and Leclerc
on fresh tires.

02:06:44.221 --> 02:06:46.473
Four laps to go.
Sonny Hayes is in P4.

02:06:46.557 --> 02:06:48.475
He's five seconds
behind his teammate,

02:06:48.559 --> 02:06:50.185
but both are on old tires.

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:52.813
There's little chance
they'll gain any places now.

02:06:55.399 --> 02:06:59.028
And here's Hamilton attacking
Pearce into turn five.

02:06:59.111 --> 02:07:00.738
And he's through.

02:07:00.821 --> 02:07:04.158
Nobody has to stop again and
our tires are nine laps older.

02:07:06.118 --> 02:07:08.787
And Leclerc attacks
and passes.

02:07:08.871 --> 02:07:12.916
Pearce's tires are absolutely finished.
There was nothing he could do about that.

02:07:13.834 --> 02:07:15.461
I'm sorry, guys.

02:07:15.544 --> 02:07:17.296
I've got nothing left.

02:07:17.379 --> 02:07:20.382
It's been the Apex
GP story all year long.

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:21.508
Plenty of risks.

02:07:21.592 --> 02:07:23.385
A great underdog story,

02:07:23.469 --> 02:07:25.512
but we know, Martin,
only talent crowns a champion.

02:07:25.596 --> 02:07:27.348
Losing grip.
Tires are gone.

02:07:27.431 --> 02:07:29.892
Yeah.
Sadly, the deck's been stacked against them

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:31.560
and now they're
out of cards to play.

02:07:31.644 --> 02:07:32.770
It ain't over, right?

02:07:32.853 --> 02:07:33.979
No, but nothing can change.

02:07:34.063 --> 02:07:35.981
It's the worst feeling
in the world.

02:07:40.778 --> 02:07:42.780
George Russell on the attack.

02:07:42.863 --> 02:07:45.407
Hayes looking to defend,
through the left-hander they go...

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:47.076
And there's contact!

02:07:47.159 --> 02:07:49.828
Hayes is spun round
and into the barrier.

02:07:49.912 --> 02:07:51.580
That's a big one.

02:07:53.457 --> 02:07:55.626
-Fucking yes, yes, yes.
-Oh, no.

02:07:56.877 --> 02:07:58.379
Yeah, no. Ooh.

02:07:58.462 --> 02:07:59.838
There's debris
all over the race track

02:07:59.922 --> 02:08:02.216
and substantial damage
to the barriers.

02:08:02.299 --> 02:08:05.177
The stewards have no choice
but to red flag this race.

02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:06.637
Miracle.

02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:08.430
And speaking
of damage, Martin,

02:08:08.514 --> 02:08:11.225
Hayes will only be allowed
to continue in this race

02:08:11.308 --> 02:08:14.353
if he can get his car
all the way around the circuit

02:08:14.436 --> 02:08:16.355
and back to the pit lane.

02:08:16.438 --> 02:08:18.691
Sonny.
Sonny, can you get it back?

02:08:18.774 --> 02:08:21.819
I'll get it back. I'll get it
back if I have to push it back.

02:08:21.902 --> 02:08:26.198
Come on, Sonny. Nice and easy.

02:08:29.034 --> 02:08:31.704
He's still going.
He's still going.

02:08:31.787 --> 02:08:33.288
JP, red flag.

02:08:33.372 --> 02:08:34.665
Red flag. Come in.

02:08:34.748 --> 02:08:38.961
We are still alive,
hermano.

02:08:39.044 --> 02:08:41.046
Red flag!

02:08:41.130 --> 02:08:44.466
And somehow Sonny Hayes
has got his car back to the pit lane.

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:46.552
-It's a miracle.
-I know! I know.

02:08:46.635 --> 02:08:48.011
Never seen one until now.

02:08:48.095 --> 02:08:51.390
Home free. Good girl. Let's go.

02:08:52.266 --> 02:08:53.559
New softs, both cars.

02:08:53.642 --> 02:08:55.978
Raise the tire pressure
for three quick laps.

02:08:56.061 --> 02:08:57.896
Team, time to build a car.

02:08:57.980 --> 02:08:59.732
Red flag rules then.

02:08:59.815 --> 02:09:02.735
The teams can make changes.
They can make repairs to their cars.

02:09:02.818 --> 02:09:04.278
But only in that pit lane.

02:09:04.361 --> 02:09:06.989
And with only ten minutes
to make repairs,

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:09.742
Apex GP has their work cut out.

02:09:09.825 --> 02:09:13.162
And all cars
can fit a fresh set of tires

02:09:13.245 --> 02:09:15.456
for what will
be a three-lap sprint.

02:09:15.539 --> 02:09:17.916
-Dodge! Dodge, are we gonna make it?
-I don't know. I don't know.

02:09:24.214 --> 02:09:26.717
That was clean.
That wasn't me. Not this time.

02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:30.471
"Not this time"?
Tell that to the stewards.

02:09:30.554 --> 02:09:31.597
Check the replay.

02:09:32.681 --> 02:09:34.558
I got this. Lift that corner.

02:09:43.025 --> 02:09:46.028
I'm good. I'm good,
I'm good. I'm good.

02:09:46.111 --> 02:09:47.529
What the stewards
will be looking at

02:09:47.613 --> 02:09:49.698
is whether Hayes
went off completely

02:09:49.782 --> 02:09:53.494
or kept at least one tire on track
during the contact with Russell.

02:09:53.577 --> 02:09:55.245
-Yo, you good?
-Yeah, good.

02:09:55.329 --> 02:09:56.622
Listen, you were on track.

02:09:56.705 --> 02:10:00.000
Yeah, it was your corner.
P3 and P4. Let's go!

02:10:00.083 --> 02:10:03.796
Given Hayes's reputation, they'll
be looking at this really, really closely.

02:10:03.879 --> 02:10:05.506
I'm not expecting
a quick decision.

02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:07.216
Come on,
that's clearly a penalty.

02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:08.967
Like... I mean,
not that that's what we want,

02:10:09.051 --> 02:10:12.888
but, like, objectively,
that's the guy.

02:10:12.971 --> 02:10:15.557
-Oh, man. It can't end this way.
-It's just a time-out.

02:10:15.641 --> 02:10:19.686
Like the last 30 years.
It's in the hands of the racing gods now.

02:10:19.770 --> 02:10:21.313
We gotta believe.
Gotta believe.

02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:25.317
Plenty going on here
in the pit.

02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:28.612
Oh, look. Here comes the new wing.
This is a massive job.

02:10:28.695 --> 02:10:32.157
Yeah, but will the car hold together
for the remaining three laps?

02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:37.913
Well, that barrier
looks okay now.

02:10:37.996 --> 02:10:41.208
The marshals just sweeping the last
few bits of debris off the track,

02:10:41.291 --> 02:10:43.418
and the clock
continues to tick down.

02:10:43.502 --> 02:10:46.922
Yeah, it's just over two minutes
until this race gets underway again.

02:11:08.110 --> 02:11:09.444
JP, JP!

02:11:10.821 --> 02:11:11.989
Three laps.

02:11:12.072 --> 02:11:13.615
Three laps is a lifetime.

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:14.867
Go win this thing.

02:11:27.045 --> 02:11:29.256
Hey, Sonny.
Sonny, you got a minute?

02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:32.593
We got you a car.

02:11:32.676 --> 02:11:36.096
Ah, you rock. Thank you.

02:11:38.849 --> 02:11:42.227
Because Apex GP didn't
make the top 10 in qualifying,

02:11:42.311 --> 02:11:45.063
they have a new set
of soft tires available,

02:11:45.147 --> 02:11:48.317
which will give them extra speed
over the cars ahead of them

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:50.736
on the used soft tires.

02:11:50.819 --> 02:11:53.655
This red flag is a lifeline.

02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:55.574
You'd almost wonder
if Sonny didn't engineer it.

02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:59.745
But wait, we're the only cars
on fresh tires

02:11:59.828 --> 02:12:01.496
because we sucked
in qualifying yesterday?

02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:03.206
Never got the chance
to use them.

02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:05.626
Sometimes when you lose,
you win.

02:12:05.709 --> 02:12:08.337
-That don't make no sense.
-It's a Sonny thing.

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:11.214
Light at the end
of the pit lane is green.

02:12:11.298 --> 02:12:14.509
We're off on our second
formation lap of the evening,

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:18.096
and when this race resumes,
this is gonna be an epic sprint.

02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:20.933
Hamilton, Leclerc, Pearce, Hayes.
That's the top four.

02:12:45.457 --> 02:12:47.209
Sonny, we just heard
from the stewards.

02:12:47.292 --> 02:12:48.627
Goddamn it. Now?

02:12:48.710 --> 02:12:50.212
We're debating
whether to tell you.

02:12:50.295 --> 02:12:52.506
Kaspar says, "Yes,"
but Kate says, "Don't."

02:12:52.589 --> 02:12:54.508
She says you're fast when you're angry.

02:12:54.591 --> 02:12:56.885
Tell her, "Job well done."

02:12:56.969 --> 02:13:00.055
And here's news.
Stewards have made their decision.

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:05.310
That Lap 55 collision between Hayes
and Russell is ruled a racing incident.

02:13:05.394 --> 02:13:07.396
No further investigation.

02:13:07.479 --> 02:13:09.272
Whoa! Sonny.

02:13:12.359 --> 02:13:15.570
That was your line, Sonny.
Go finish your race.

02:13:19.032 --> 02:13:21.702
Joshua, we still got two cars
in the mix.

02:13:21.785 --> 02:13:22.995
Then we've got a team.

02:13:24.454 --> 02:13:26.039
Once those
red lights go out,

02:13:26.123 --> 02:13:28.333
this will be an absolute
sprint to the finish.

02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:32.087
Position advantage
to Mercedes and Ferrari.

02:13:32.170 --> 02:13:34.381
Tire advantage to Apex GP.

02:14:01.033 --> 02:14:02.868
Tell JP to follow my lead.

02:14:02.951 --> 02:14:04.703
Joshua,
Sonny says to follow him.

02:14:04.786 --> 02:14:06.246
Follow? He's behind me.

02:14:08.582 --> 02:14:11.126
-Cheeky bastard.
-That's it. Stay with me.

02:14:20.427 --> 02:14:21.553
He's giving you a tow.
Take it.

02:14:21.636 --> 02:14:22.804
All the way.

02:14:50.415 --> 02:14:52.501
Come on, kid. Get it. Come on!

02:14:52.584 --> 02:14:54.669
Hayes plays the decoy,

02:14:54.753 --> 02:14:59.007
and Pearce rockets past
Leclerc and up into second.

02:14:59.091 --> 02:15:01.551
And Leclerc's in danger
from Sonny Hayes.

02:15:01.635 --> 02:15:04.429
Round the outside,
he's up into P3.

02:15:04.513 --> 02:15:06.389
Perfect teamwork.

02:15:06.473 --> 02:15:10.143
Hayes and Pearce working
together, it's like racing ballet.

02:15:10.227 --> 02:15:12.020
It's a beautiful sight,

02:15:12.104 --> 02:15:16.358
but now their sights are set on
the race leader, Lewis Hamilton.

02:15:16.441 --> 02:15:17.776
Yeah! Remember me?

02:15:27.494 --> 02:15:29.204
Come on, boys. Send it!

02:15:56.398 --> 02:15:57.691
Why didn't they overtake?

02:15:57.774 --> 02:15:59.526
Lewis will defend
whichever car attacks first.

02:15:59.609 --> 02:16:02.529
-But they both can't wait.
-Someone has to sacrifice.

02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:09.494
Two onto one,

02:16:09.578 --> 02:16:11.746
and all the pressure
is on Lewis Hamilton

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:14.416
as Apex work as a pack.

02:16:15.667 --> 02:16:16.710
Go win it, kid.

02:16:16.793 --> 02:16:18.753
Hayes makes the first move.

02:16:18.837 --> 02:16:21.506
-Hamilton defends. Pearce attacks.
-Yeah!

02:16:21.590 --> 02:16:24.009
And Pearce has P1.

02:16:24.092 --> 02:16:25.177
-Yes!
-Yes, yes!

02:16:27.554 --> 02:16:29.472
Toe-to-toe,
wheel-to-wheel,

02:16:29.556 --> 02:16:33.310
this is epic racing
to finish off the season.

02:16:33.393 --> 02:16:36.021
And Sonny Hayes and Lewis
Hamilton aren't done yet.

02:16:36.104 --> 02:16:38.064
Hamilton, on Sonny Hayes.

02:16:38.148 --> 02:16:39.357
There's contact!

02:16:39.441 --> 02:16:41.318
And through goes Hamilton.

02:16:44.154 --> 02:16:46.489
-Yes, yes!
-Come on!

02:16:46.573 --> 02:16:48.325
Yes!

02:16:48.408 --> 02:16:50.994
Guys, talk to me.
Where's Sonny? Can he finish?

02:16:51.077 --> 02:16:53.246
One more lap, JP.
Hamilton never backs down.

02:16:53.330 --> 02:16:55.457
Can Sonny finish the race, man?

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:57.667
Yes, he's on track.
Just watch Lewis when he fights.

02:16:57.751 --> 02:17:00.212
You're P1. No more risks.

02:17:00.295 --> 02:17:01.338
No such thing.

02:17:04.090 --> 02:17:06.635
The rookie holds his line.
He won't back down.

02:17:06.718 --> 02:17:10.180
He's here to fight
the seven-time world champion.

02:17:14.142 --> 02:17:15.560
That made contact.

02:17:15.644 --> 02:17:19.731
The leader and Lewis Hamilton
are out of this race.

02:17:19.814 --> 02:17:23.902
Despite yellow flags flying
at turn one, this race will continue.

02:17:23.985 --> 02:17:26.529
Sonny, push, push, push.
You're P1! You're P1!

02:17:26.613 --> 02:17:29.241
Apex GP
has only one lap to go.

02:17:29.324 --> 02:17:32.244
The question is
do they have the car?

02:17:32.327 --> 02:17:34.079
We have the driver.

02:17:38.166 --> 02:17:40.210
Yeah! Go on, Sonny!

02:18:25.422 --> 02:18:26.298
What's happening?

02:18:27.007 --> 02:18:28.425
He's flying.

02:18:53.575 --> 02:18:55.493
Sonny, you did it!
We won! We won!

02:18:56.703 --> 02:18:58.163
Yeah!

02:19:02.917 --> 02:19:04.586
Yes!

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:10.508
Yeah!

02:19:15.013 --> 02:19:16.431
We won!

02:19:16.514 --> 02:19:19.100
Yeah!

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:23.063
Yeah!

02:19:24.731 --> 02:19:25.857
We won!

02:19:27.942 --> 02:19:31.696
-We did it! Whoo!
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:19:33.365 --> 02:19:35.742
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

02:19:40.163 --> 02:19:42.499
-Come on! Yes!
-Yes!

02:19:54.135 --> 02:19:56.304
Means another three years
for Ruben, right?

02:19:57.931 --> 02:19:58.932
Yeah.

02:20:00.308 --> 02:20:01.518
I guess we'll check
back about that deal.

02:20:04.729 --> 02:20:06.564
Presuming you're still
on the board.

02:20:15.949 --> 02:20:19.702
Breathtaking!
Breathless! Incredible!

02:20:19.786 --> 02:20:22.539
What an Abu Dhabi Grand Prix
this has been!

02:20:22.622 --> 02:20:24.916
What a victory as well!

02:20:24.999 --> 02:20:29.170
Absolutely. It's a race
for the ages. An absolute thriller.

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:32.924
-And this man wins his first Grand Prix.
-Well done.

02:20:33.007 --> 02:20:34.717
-It's been 30 years in the making.
-Well done!

02:20:34.801 --> 02:20:38.138
And the team did a brilliant
job from the pit wall.

02:20:38.221 --> 02:20:41.516
-And of course we can't forget Pearce...
-Oi! What you smiling about?

02:20:41.599 --> 02:20:44.102
-...playing his part in this victory.
-You.

02:20:44.185 --> 02:20:46.146
I'm gonna win a million races.
You should at least have one.

02:20:48.773 --> 02:20:50.024
We did it.

02:20:50.859 --> 02:20:52.026
Yeah, we did.

02:20:57.031 --> 02:20:58.032
Whoo!

02:21:06.040 --> 02:21:07.167
Sonny!

02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:08.543
No, no, no, no. Give it to him.

02:21:09.461 --> 02:21:10.753
No, no, no. Give it to him.

02:21:13.631 --> 02:21:15.800
Oh, my God.
Thank you. Thank you.

02:21:28.605 --> 02:21:30.398
Let's go!

02:21:32.609 --> 02:21:34.152
I love you.

02:21:42.076 --> 02:21:44.204
Yeah!

02:21:44.287 --> 02:21:46.414
Today we get to say...

02:21:46.498 --> 02:21:48.625
"We are the best in the world!"

02:22:59.153 --> 02:23:00.655
Joshua.

02:23:00.738 --> 02:23:02.865
If you were ever to consider
to drive somewhere else,

02:23:02.949 --> 02:23:04.117
you know where to find me.

02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:07.579
Thanks, Toto,
but I'm happy where I am.

02:23:08.246 --> 02:23:09.539
Congratulations.

02:23:12.125 --> 02:23:14.252
Yeah, baby! Let them wait!

02:23:14.335 --> 02:23:16.087
Let them wait!

02:23:19.674 --> 02:23:20.883
The cup!

02:23:20.967 --> 02:23:23.720
Kate, you built
a hell of a car.

02:24:27.492 --> 02:24:29.035
Another race
I don't know about?

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:31.746
Somewhere.

02:24:33.581 --> 02:24:35.166
That beats this?

02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:39.754
Yeah.

02:24:43.633 --> 02:24:46.552
I wanted to say,
"See you down the road,"

02:24:46.636 --> 02:24:48.763
but in a way
that was more poetic.

02:24:51.808 --> 02:24:52.809
So...

02:24:55.269 --> 02:24:56.688
Can I see you down the road?

02:25:02.235 --> 02:25:03.236
Yes.

02:25:19.544 --> 02:25:21.003
Hang on to that until then.

02:25:23.464 --> 02:25:25.007
Okay.

02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:29.971
And drive fast.

02:25:40.189 --> 02:25:41.107
And where do you
think you're going?

02:25:42.692 --> 02:25:45.069
Don't worry about me.
Go celebrate.

02:25:45.153 --> 02:25:47.071
But you're off to where?

02:25:47.155 --> 02:25:50.241
You know,
couple more dragons to slay.

02:25:50.324 --> 02:25:51.576
It's your team now.

02:25:54.579 --> 02:25:55.872
It was always my team.

02:25:59.333 --> 02:26:00.293
I'll be watching.

02:26:01.753 --> 02:26:03.087
See you around, swan.

02:27:18.955 --> 02:27:19.956
Hello!

02:27:21.332 --> 02:27:22.124
Buenas.

02:27:26.337 --> 02:27:27.630
I'm told you're looking
for a driver.

02:27:29.006 --> 02:27:30.216
What's your name?

02:27:31.425 --> 02:27:32.510
Sonny Hayes.

02:27:37.056 --> 02:27:38.641
Have you ever driven Baja?

02:27:39.809 --> 02:27:40.810
Nope.

02:27:41.561 --> 02:27:42.687
We can't pay much.

02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:44.647
Not about the money.

02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:50.820
So what is it about?
